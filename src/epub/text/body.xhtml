<h2>STORY OF THE PLAY</h2></div>
<p>The play is laid on an island somewhere on our
planet, and on this island is the central office of the
factory of Rossum’s Universal Robots. “Robot”
is a Czech word meaning “worker.” When the
play opens, a few decades beyond the present day,
the factory had turned out already, following a
secret formula, hundreds of thousands, and even millions,
of manufactured workmen, living automats,
without souls, desires or feelings. They are high-powered
laborers, good for nothing but work. There
are two grades, the unskilled and the skilled, and
especially trained workmen are furnished on request.</p>
<p>When Helena Glory, president of the Humanitarian
League, comes to ascertain what can be done
to improve the condition of those overspecialized
creatures, Harry Domin, the general manager of the
factory, captures her heart and hand in the speediest
courting on record in our theatre. The last two acts
take place ten years later. Due to the desire of
Helena to have the Robots more like human beings,
Dr. Gall, the head of the physiological and experimental
departments, has secretly changed the formula,
and while he has partially humanized only a
few hundreds, there are enough to make ringleaders,
and a world revolt of robots is under way. This<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4" name="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
revolution is easily accomplished, as robots have
long since been used when needed as soldiers and
the robots far outnumber human beings.</p>
<p>The rest of the play is magnificent melodrama,
superbly portrayed, with the handful of human
beings at bay while the unseen myriads of their own
robots close in on them. The final scene is like Dunsany
on a mammoth scale.</p>
<p>Then comes the epilogue, in which Alquist, the
company’s builder, is not only the only human being
on the island, but also the only one left on earth.
The robots have destroyed the rest of mankind.
They spared his life because he was a worker. And
he is spending his days unceasingly endeavoring to
discover and reconstruct the lost formula. The
robots are doomed. They saved the wrong man.
They should have spared the company’s physicist.
The robots know that their bodies will wear out in
time and there will be no new multitudes of robots
to replace them. But Alquist discovers two humanized
robots, a young man and young woman, who
have a bit of Adam and Eve in them, and the audience
perceives that mankind is about to start afresh.
Nature has won out, after all.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Domin.</span> How do you do? What can I do for you?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> You are Mr. Domin, the General Manager?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Domin.</span> I am.</p>

(<i>Exit</i> <span class="smcap">Sulla</span> <small>L.</small> <i>Sitting down</i> <small>L.</small> <i>of desk</i>) How can I
be of service to you, Miss Glory?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> I have come— (<i>Sits</i> <small>R.</small> <i>of desk.</i>)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Domin.</span> To have a look at our famous works
where people are manufactured. Like all visitors.
Well, there is no objection.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> I thought it was forbidden to—</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Domin.</span> To enter the factory? Yes, of course.
Everybody comes here with someone’s visiting card,
Miss Glory.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> And you show them—</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Domin.</span> Only certain things. The manufacture of
artificial people is a secret process.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> If you only knew how enormously that—</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Domin.</span> Interests you. Europe’s talking about
nothing else.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12" name="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> (<i>Indignantly turning front</i>) Why don’t
you let me finish speaking?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Domin.</span> (<i>Drier</i>) I beg your pardon. Did you want
to say something different?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> I only wanted to ask—</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Domin.</span> Whether I could make a special exception
in your case and show you our factory. Why, certainly,
Miss Glory.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> How do you know I wanted to say that?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Domin.</span> They all do. But we shall consider it a
special honor to show you more than we do the
rest.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> Thank you.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Domin.</span> (<i>Standing</i>) But you must agree not to
divulge the least—</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> (<i>Standing and giving him her hand</i>) My
word of honor.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Domin.</span> Thank you. (<i>Looking at her hand</i>) Won’t
you raise your veil?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> Of course. You want to see whether I’m
a spy or not—I beg your pardon.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Domin.</span> (<i>Leaning forward</i>) What is it?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> Would you mind releasing my hand?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Domin.</span> (<i>Releasing it</i>) Oh, I beg <i>your</i> pardon.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> (<i>Raising veil</i>) How cautious you have
to be here, don’t you?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Domin.</span> (<i>Observing her with deep interest</i>) Why,
yes. Hm—of course—We—that is—</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> But what is it? What’s the matter?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Domin.</span> I’m remarkably pleased. Did you have a
pleasant crossing?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> Yes.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Domin.</span> No difficulty?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> Why?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Domin.</span> What I mean to say is—you’re so <i>young</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> May we go straight into the factory?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Domin.</span> Yes. Twenty-two, I think.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> Twenty-two what?</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13" name="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Domin.</span> Years.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> Twenty-one. Why do you want to know?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Domin.</span> Well, because—as— (<i>Sits on desk nearer
her</i>) You will make a long stay, won’t you?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> (<i>Backing away</i> <small>R.</small>) That depends on how
much of the factory you show me.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Domin.</span> (<i>Rises; crosses to her</i>) Oh, hang the factory.
Oh, no, no, you shall see everything, Miss
Glory. Indeed you shall. Won’t you sit down?
(<i>Takes her to couch</i> <small>R.C.</small> <i>She sits. Offers her cigarette
from case at end of sofa. She refuses.</i>)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> Thank you.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Domin.</span> But first would you like to hear the story
of the invention?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> Yes, indeed.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Domin.</span> (<i>Crosses to</i> <small>L.C.</small> <i>near desk</i>) It was in the
year 1920 that old Rossum, the great physiologist,
who was then quite a young scientist, took himself
to the distant island for the purpose of studying
the ocean fauna. (<i>She is amused.</i>) On this occasion
he attempted by chemical synthesis to imitate the
living matter known as protoplasm until he suddenly
discovered a substance which behaved exactly
like living matter although its chemical composition
was different. That was in the year 1932, exactly
four hundred and forty years after the discovery
of America. Whew—</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> Do you know that by heart?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Domin.</span> (<i>Takes flowers from desk to her</i>) Yes.
You see, physiology is not in my line. Shall I go on?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> (<i>Smelling flowers</i>) Yes, please.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Domin.</span> (<i>Center</i>) And then, Miss Glory, Old Rossum
wrote the following among his chemical experiments:
“Nature has found only one method of organizing
living matter. There is, however, another
method, more simple, flexible and rapid which has
not yet occurred to Nature at all. This second process
by which life can be developed was discovered by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14" name="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
me today.” Now imagine him, Miss Glory, writing
those wonderful words over some colloidal mess
that a dog wouldn’t look at. Imagine him sitting over
a test tube and thinking how the whole tree of life
would grow from him, how all animals would proceed
from it, beginning with some sort of a beetle
and ending with a <i>man</i>. A man of different substance
from us. Miss Glory, that was a tremendous
moment. (<i>Gets box of candy from desk and passes
it to her.</i>)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> Well—</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Domin.</span> (<i>As she speaks his portable PHONE
lights up and he answers</i>) Well—Hello!—Yes—no,
I’m in conference. Don’t disturb me.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> Well?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Domin.</span> (<i>Smile</i>) Now, the thing was how to get
the life <i>out</i> of the test tubes, and hasten development
and form organs, bones and nerves, and so on, and
find such substances as catalytics, enzymes, hormones
in short—you understand?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> Not much, I’m afraid.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Domin.</span> Never mind. (<i>Leans over couch and fixes
cushion for her back</i>) There! You see with the help
of his tinctures he could make whatever he wanted.
He could have produced a Medusa with the brain
of Socrates or a worm fifty yards long— (<i>She laughs.
He does also; leans closer on couch, then straightens
up again</i>) —but being without a grain of humor, he
took into his head to make a vertebrate or perhaps
a man. This artificial living <i>matter</i> of his had a raging
thirst for life. It didn’t mind being sown or
mixed together. That couldn’t be done with natural
albumen. And that’s how he set about it.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> About what?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Domin.</span> About imitating Nature. First of all he
tried making an artificial dog. That took him several
years and resulted in a sort of stunted calf which
<i>died</i> in a few days. I’ll show it to you in the museum.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15" name="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
And <i>then</i> old Rossum started on the manufacture of
<i>man</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> And I’m to divulge this to nobody?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Domin.</span> To nobody in the world.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> What a pity that it’s to be discovered in
<i>all</i> the school books of both Europe and America.
(<span class="smcap">Both</span> <i>laugh.</i>)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Domin.</span> Yes. But do you know what <i>isn’t</i> in the
school books? That old Rossum was mad. Seriously,
Miss Glory, you must keep this to yourself. The old
crank wanted to actually make <i>people</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> But you do make people.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Domin.</span> <i>Approximately</i>—Miss Glory. But old Rossum
meant it literally. He wanted to become a sort
of scientific substitute for <i>God</i>. He was a fearful
materialist, and that’s why he did it all. His sole
purpose was nothing more or less than to prove that
God was no longer necessary. (<i>Crosses to end of
couch</i>) Do you know anything about anatomy?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> Very little.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Domin.</span> Neither do I. Well— (<i>He laughs</i>) —he
then decided to manufacture everything as in the
human body. I’ll show you in the museum the
bungling attempt it took him ten years to produce.
It was to have been a <i>man</i>, but it lived for three days
only. Then up came <i>young</i> Rossum, an engineer. He
was a wonderful fellow, Miss Glory. When he saw
what a mess of it the old man was making he said:
“It’s absurd to spend ten years making a man. If
you can’t make him quicker than Nature, you might
as well shut up shop.” Then he set about learning
anatomy himself.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> There’s nothing about <i>that</i> in the school
books?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Domin.</span> No. The school books are full of paid
advertisements, and rubbish at that. What the
school books say about the <i>united efforts</i> of the two
great Rossums is all a fairy tale. They used to have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16" name="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
dreadful rows. The old <i>atheist</i> hadn’t the slightest
conception of industrial <i>matters</i>, and the end of it
was that Young Rossum shut him up in some laboratory
or other and let him fritter the time away with
his monstrosities while he himself started on the
business from an <i>engineer’s</i> point of view. Old Rossum
<i>cursed</i> him and before he died he managed to
botch up two physiological horrors. Then one day
they found him dead in the <i>laboratory</i>. And that’s
his whole story.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> And what about the young man?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Domin.</span> (<i>Sits beside her on couch</i>) Well, anyone
who has looked into human anatomy will have seen
at once that man is too complicated, and that a good
engineer could make him more simply. So young
Rossum began to <i>overhaul</i> anatomy to see what
could be left out or simplified. In short—But this
isn’t boring you, Miss Glory?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> No, indeed. You’re—It’s awfully interesting.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Domin.</span> (<i>Gets closer</i>) So young Rossum said to
himself: “A man is something that feels happy, plays
the piano, likes going for a walk, and, in fact, wants
to do a whole lot of things that are really unnecessary.”</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> Oh.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Domin.</span> That are unnecessary when he wants— (<i>Takes
her hand</i>) —let us say, to weave or count.
Do you play the piano?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> Yes.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Domin.</span> That’s good. (<i>Kisses her hand. She lowers
her head.</i>) Oh, I beg your pardon! (<i>Rises</i>) But a
working machine must <i>not</i> play the piano, must not
feel happy, must not do a whole lot of other things.
A gasoline motor must not have tassels or ornaments,
Miss Glory. And to manufacture artificial
workers is the same thing as the manufacture of a
gasoline motor. (<i>She is not interested.</i>) The process<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17" name="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
must be the simplest, and the product the best from
a practical point of view. (<i>Sits beside her again</i>)
What sort of worker do you think is the <i>best</i> from
a practical point of view?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> (<i>Absently</i>) What? (<i>Looks at him.</i>)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Domin.</span> What sort of worker do you think is the
best from a practical point of view?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> (<i>Pulling herself together</i>) Oh! Perhaps
the one who is most honest and hard-working.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Domin.</span> No. The one that is the <i>cheapest</i>. The one
whose requirements are the <i>smallest</i>. Young Rossum
invented a worker with the minimum amount of requirements.
He had to simplify him. He rejected
everything that did not contribute directly to the
progress of work. Everything that makes man more
expensive. In fact he <i>rejected man</i> and made the
<i>Robot</i>. My dear Miss Glory, the Robots are not
people. Mechanically they are more <i>perfect</i> than we
are; they have an enormously developed intelligence,
but they have no soul. (<i>Leans back.</i>)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> How do you know they have no soul?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Domin.</span> Have you ever seen what a Robot looks
like inside?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> No.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Domin.</span> Very neat, very simple. Really a beautiful
piece of work. Not much <i>in</i> it, but everything in
flawless order. The product of an engineer <i>is</i> technically
at a higher pitch of perfection than a product
of Nature.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> But man is supposed to be the product
of God.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Domin.</span> All the worse. God hasn’t the slightest
notion of modern engineering. Would you believe
that young Rossum then proceeded to play at being
God?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> (<i>Awed</i>) How do you mean?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Domin.</span> He began to manufacture Super-Robots.
Regular giants they were. He tried to make them<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18" name="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
twelve feet tall. But you wouldn’t believe what a
failure they were.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> A failure?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Domin.</span> Yes. For no reason at all their limbs used
to keep snapping off. “Evidently our planet is too
small for giants.” Now we only make Robots of
normal size and of very high-class human finish.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> (<i>Hands him flower; he puts it in button-hole</i>)
I saw the first Robots at home. The Town
Council bought them for—I mean engaged them for
work.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Domin.</span> No. <i>Bought</i> them, Miss Glory. Robots are
bought and sold.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> These were employed as street-sweepers.
I saw them sweeping. They were so strange and
quiet.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Domin.</span> (<i>Rises</i>) Rossum’s Universal Robot factory
doesn’t produce a uniform brand of Robots.
We have Robots of <i>finer</i> and <i>coarser</i> grades. The
best will live about <i>twenty</i> years. (<i>Crosses to desk.</i>

<p><span class="smcap">Domin.</span> (<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Sulla</span>, <i>laughing</i>) Sulla is a Robot,

That’s a good powerful vessel.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Domin.</span> What’s its speed?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Sulla.</span> Forty knots an hour. Fifty thousand tons.
One of the latest vessels, Miss Glory.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> Thank you.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Sulla.</span> A crew of fifteen hundred, Captain Harpy,

<p><span class="smcap">Domin.</span> That’ll do, Sulla. Now show us your

<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> You know French?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Sulla.</span> Oui! Madame! I know four languages. I

Cteny pane.”</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> (<i>Jumping up, crosses to</i> <span class="smcap">Sulla</span>) Oh,
that’s absurd! Sulla isn’t a Robot. Sulla is a girl like
me. Sulla, this is outrageous—Why do you take
part in such a hoax?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Sulla.</span> I am a Robot.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> No, no, you are not telling the truth.
(<i>She catches the amused expression on</i> <span class="smcap">Domin’s</span>

you? (<i>Looks at him.</i>)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Domin.</span> I’m sorry, Miss Glory. <i>Sulla is a Robot.</i></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> It’s a lie!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> (<i>Stopping</i> <span class="smcap">Marius</span>) No! No!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Domin.</span> Excuse me, you spoke of lies.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sulla.</span> I am a Robot.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> That doesn’t matter. Robots are just as

<p><span class="smcap">Sulla.</span> Yes. (<i>Hand away.</i>)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> Oh, you’re not afraid of death, then?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Sulla.</span> I cannot tell, Miss Glory.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> Do you know what would happen to you

<p><span class="smcap">Sulla.</span> Yes, I should cease to move.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marius.</span> (<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Helena</span>) Marius, the Robot.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Domin.</span> Would you take Sulla into the dissecting

<p><span class="smcap">Marius.</span> (<i>Turns to</i> <span class="smcap">Domin</span>) Yes.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Domin.</span> Would you be sorry for her?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Marius.</span> (<i>Pause</i>) I cannot tell.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Domin.</span> What would happen to her?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Marius.</span> She would cease to move. They would

<p><span class="smcap">Domin.</span> That is death, Marius. Aren’t you afraid
of death?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Marius.</span> No.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Domin.</span> You see, Miss Glory, the Robots have no
interest in life. They have no enjoyments. They are

<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> Oh, stop. Please send them away.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> I don’t know, but it is. Why do you call

<p><span class="smcap">Domin.</span> Isn’t it a nice name? (<i>Hand away.</i>)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> It’s a man’s name. Sulla was a Roman
General.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Domin.</span> What! Oh! (<i>Laughs</i>) We thought that
Marius and Sulla were lovers.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> (<i>Indignantly</i>) Marius and Sulla were
generals and fought against each other in the year—I’ve

<p><span class="smcap">Domin.</span> (<i>Laughing</i>) Come here to the window.

<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> What?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Domin.</span> Come here. (<i>She goes.</i>) Do you see anything?
(<i>Takes her arm. She is on his</i> <small>R.</small>)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> Bricklayers.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Domin.</span> Robots. All our work people are Robots.
And down there, can you see anything?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> Some sort of office.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Domin.</span> A counting house. And in it—</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> A lot of officials.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Domin.</span> Robots! All our officials are Robots. And
when you see the factory— (<i>Noon WHISTLE
blows. She is scared; puts arm on</i> <span class="smcap">Domin.</span> <i>He

won’t stop working. In two hours I’ll show you the

<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> Kneading trough?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Domin.</span> The pestle for beating up the paste. In
each one we mix the ingredients for a thousand
Robots at one operation. Then there are the vats for
the preparation of liver, brains, and so on. Then<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23" name="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
you will see the bone factory. After that I’ll show
you the spinning mill.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> Spinning mill?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Domin.</span> Yes. For weaving nerves and veins. Miles

time.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> (<i>Watching his gestures</i>) Mayn’t we talk
about something else?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Domin.</span> Perhaps it would be better. There’s only

<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> No, thank you.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Domin.</span> Do you mind if I do?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> Certainly not.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Busman.</span> Well, now, Miss Glory, it is certainly
nice to have you with us.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> (<i>Seriously</i>) But you know I’ve come to
disturb your Robots for you. (<span class="smcap">Busman</span> <i>pulls chair
closer.</i>)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Domin.</span> (<i>Mocking her serious tone</i>) My dear Miss
Glory— (<i>Chuckle</i>) —we’ve had close upon a hundred
saviors and prophets here. Every ship brings us
some. Missionaries, Anarchists, Salvation Army, all
sorts! It’s astonishing what a number of churches
and idiots there are in the world.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> And yet you let them speak to the
Robots.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Domin.</span> So far we’ve let them all. Why not? The
Robot remembers everything but that’s all. They
don’t even laugh at what the people say. Really it’s
quite incredible.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> I’m a stupid girl. Send me back by the
first ship.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Gall.</span> Not for anything in the world, Miss
Glory. Why should we send you back?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Domin.</span> If it would amuse you, Miss Glory, I’ll
take you down to the Robot warehouse. It holds
about three hundred thousand of them.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Busman.</span> Three hundred and forty-seven thousand.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Domin.</span> Good, and you can say whatever you like
to them. You can read the Bible, recite the multiplication
table, whatever you please. You can even
preach to them about human rights.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> Oh, I think that if you were to show
them a little love.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28" name="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Fabry.</span> Impossible, Miss Glory! <i>Nothing is harder
to like than a Robot.</i></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> What do you make them for, then?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Busman.</span> Ha, ha, ha! That’s good. What are Robots
made for?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Fabry.</span> For <i>work</i>, Miss Glory. One Robot can replace
two and a half <i>workmen</i>. The human machine,
Miss Glory, was terribly <i>imperfect</i>. It had to be removed
sooner or later.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Busman.</span> It was too expensive.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Fabry.</span> It was not <i>effective</i>. It no longer answers
the requirements of <i>modern engineering</i>. Nature has
no idea of keeping pace with <i>modern labor</i>. For example,
from a technical point of view, the whole of
<i>childhood</i> is a sheer absurdity. So much time lost.
And then again—</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> (<i>Turns to</i> <span class="smcap">Domin</span>) Oh, no, no!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Fabry.</span> Pardon me. What is the real <i>aim</i> of your
League—the—the Humanity League?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> Its real purpose is to—to protect the
Robots—and—and to insure good treatment for
them.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Fabry.</span> Not a bad object, either. A machine has
to be treated properly. (<i>Leans back</i>) <i>I don’t like
damaged articles.</i> Please, Miss Glory, enroll us all
<i>members</i> of your league. (“<i>Yes, yes!</i>” <i>from all</i>
<span class="smcap">Men</span>.)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> No, you don’t understand me. What we
really want is to—to—<i>liberate</i> the Robots. (<i>Looks at
all</i> <span class="smcap">Others</span>.)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hallemeier.</span> How do you propose to do that?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> They are to be—to be dealt with like
human beings.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hallemeier.</span> Aha! I suppose they’re to vote. To
drink beer. To order us about?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> Why shouldn’t they drink beer?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hallemeier.</span> Perhaps they’re even to receive
wages? (<i>Looking at other</i> <span class="smcap">Men</span>, <i>amused.</i>)</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29" name="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> Of course they are.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hallemeier.</span> Fancy that! Now! And what would
they do with their wages, pray?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> They would buy—what they want—what
pleases them.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hallemeier.</span> That would be very nice, Miss
Glory, only there’s nothing that does please the
Robots. Good heavens, what are they to buy? You
can feed them on pineapples, straw, whatever you
like. It’s all the <i>same</i> to them. They’ve no appetite
at all. They’ve no interest in anything. Why, hang
it all, nobody’s ever yet seen a Robot smile.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> Why—why don’t you make them—happier?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hallemeier.</span> That wouldn’t do, Miss Glory. They
are only workmen.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> Oh, but they’re so intelligent.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hallemeier.</span> Confoundedly so, but they’re nothing
else. They’ve no will of their own. No soul. No
passion.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> No love?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hallemeier.</span> Love? Huh! Rather not. Robots
don’t love. Not even themselves.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> No defiance?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hallemeier.</span> Defiance? I don’t know. Only <i>rarely</i>,
from time to time.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> What happens then?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hallemeier.</span> Nothing particular. Occasionally
they seem to go off their <i>heads</i>. Something like epilepsy,
you know. It’s called “Robot’s Cramp.”
They’ll suddenly sling down everything they’re holding,
stand still, gnash their teeth—and then they
have to go into the stamping-mill. It’s evidently some
breakdown in the mechanism.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Domin.</span> (<i>Sitting on desk</i>) A flaw in the works
that has to be removed.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> No, no, that’s the soul.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Fabry.</span> (<i>Humorously</i>) Do you think that the soul<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30" name="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
first shows itself by a gnashing of teeth? (<span class="smcap">Men</span>
<i>chuckle.</i>)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> Perhaps it’s just a sign that there’s a
struggle within. Perhaps it’s a sort of revolt. Oh, if
you could infuse them with it.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Domin.</span> That’ll be remedied, Miss Glory. Doctor
Gall is just making some experiments.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Gall.</span> Not with regard to that, Domin. At
present I am making <i>pain</i> nerves.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> Pain nerves?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Gall.</span> Yes, the Robots feel practically no bodily
pain. You see, young Rossum provided them with
too limited a <i>nervous</i> system. We <i>must</i> introduce
<i>suffering</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> Why do you want to cause them pain?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Gall.</span> For industrial reasons, Miss Glory.
Sometimes a Robot does damage to himself because
it doesn’t hurt him. He puts his hand into the machine— (<i>Describes
with gesture</i>) —breaks his finger— (<i>Describes
with gesture</i>) —smashes his head. It’s
all the same to him. We must provide them with
<i>pain</i>. That’s an automatic <i>protection</i> against damage.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> Will they be happier when they feel
pain?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Gall.</span> On the contrary; but they will be more
perfect from a technical point of view.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> Why don’t you create a soul for them?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Gall.</span> That’s not in our power.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Fabry.</span> That’s not in our interest.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Busman.</span> That would increase the cost of production.
Hang it all, my dear young lady, we turn
them out at such a cheap rate—a hundred and fifty
dollars each, fully dressed, and fifteen years ago
they cost ten thousand. Five years ago we used to
buy the <i>clothes</i> for them. Today we have our own
weaving mill, and now we even <i>export</i> cloth five
times cheaper than other factories. What do you
pay a yard for cloth, Miss Glory?</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31" name="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> (<i>Looking at</i> <span class="smcap">Domin</span>) I don’t really
know. I’ve forgotten.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Busman.</span> Good gracious, and you want to found a
Humanity League. (<span class="smcap">Men</span> <i>chuckle.</i>) It only costs a
third now, Miss Glory. All prices are today a third
of what they were and they’ll fall still lower, lower,
like that.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> I don’t understand.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Busman.</span> Why, bless you, Miss Glory, it means
that the cost of <i>labor</i> has fallen. A Robot, food and
all, costs three-quarters of a cent per hour. (<i>Leans
forward</i>) That’s mighty important, you know. All
factories will go pop like chestnuts if they don’t at
once buy Robots to lower the cost of production.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> And get rid of all their workmen?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Busman.</span> Of course. But in the meantime we’ve
dumped five hundred thousand <i>tropical</i> Robots
down on the Argentine pampas to grow corn. Would
you mind telling me how much you pay a pound for
bread?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> I’ve no idea. (<span class="smcap">All</span> <i>smile.</i>)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Busman.</span> Well, I’ll tell you. It now costs two cents
in good old Europe. A pound of bread for two
cents, and the <i>Humanity League</i>— (<i>Designates</i> <span class="smcap">Helena</span>) —knows
nothing about it. (<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Men</span>) Miss
Glory, you don’t realize that even <i>that’s</i> too expensive.
(<i>All</i> <span class="smcap">Men</span> <i>chuckle.</i>) Why, in five years’ time
I’ll wager—</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> What?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Busman.</span> That the cost of everything will be a
tenth of what it is today. Why, in five years we’ll be
up to our ears in corn and—everything else.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Alquist.</span> Yes, and all the workers throughout the
world will be unemployed.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Domin.</span> (<i>Seriously. Rises</i>) Yes, Alquist, they will.
Yes, Miss Glory, they will. But in ten years Rossum’s
Universal Robots will produce so much <i>corn</i>, so
much <i>cloth</i>, so much everything that things will be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32" name="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
practically without price. There will be no poverty.
All work will be done by living machines. Everybody
will be free from worry and liberated from
the degradation of labor. Everybody will live only
to <i>perfect</i> himself.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> Will he?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Domin.</span> Of course. It’s bound to happen. Then
the servitude of man to man and the enslavement
of man to matter will cease. Nobody will get bread
at the cost of life and hatred. The Robots will wash
the feet of the beggar and prepare a bed for him in
his house.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Alquist.</span> Domin, Domin, what you say sounds
too much like Paradise. There was something <i>good</i>
in <i>service</i> and something <i>great</i> in humility. There
was some kind of virtue in <i>toil</i> and <i>weariness</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Domin.</span> Perhaps, but we cannot reckon with what
is lost when we start out to transform the world.
Man shall be <i>free</i> and supreme; he shall have no
other aim, no other labor, no other care than to perfect
himself. He shall serve neither matter nor man.
He will not be a machine and a device for production.
He will be <i>Lord</i> of creation.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Busman.</span> Amen.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Fabry.</span> So be it.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> (<i>Rises</i>) You have bewildered me. I
should like to believe this.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Gall.</span> You are younger than we are, Miss
Glory. You will live to see it.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hallemeier.</span> True. (<i>Looking around</i>) Don’t you
think Miss Glory might lunch with us? (<i>All</i> <span class="smcap">Men</span> <i>rise.</i>)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Gall.</span> Of course. Domin, ask her on behalf
of us all.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Domin.</span> Miss Glory, will you do us the honor?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> When you know why I’ve come?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Fabry.</span> For the League of Humanity, Miss Glory.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> Oh, in that case perhaps—</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33" name="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Fabry.</span> That’s fine. (<i>Pause</i>) Miss Glory, excuse
me for five minutes. (<i>Exits</i> <small>R.</small>)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hallemeier.</span> Thank you. (<i>Exits</i> <small>R.</small> <i>with</i> <span class="smcap">Dr.
Gall</span>.)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Busman.</span> (<i>Whispering</i>) I’ll be back soon. (<i>Beckoning
to</i> <span class="smcap">Alquist</span>, <i>they exit.</i>)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Alquist.</span> (<i>Starts, stops, then to</i> <span class="smcap">Helena</span>, <i>then to
door</i>) I’ll be back in exactly five minutes. (<i>Exits</i> <small>R.</small>)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> What have they all gone for?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Domin.</span> To cook, Miss Glory. (<i>On her</i> <small>L.</small>)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> To cook what?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Domin.</span> Lunch. (<i>They laugh; takes her hand</i>) The
Robots do our cooking for us and as they’ve no
taste it’s not altogether— (<i>She laughs.</i>) Hallemeier
is awfully <i>good</i> at grills and Gall can make any kind
of sauce, and Busman knows all about omelets.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> What a feast! And what’s the specialty
of Mr.—your builder?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Domin.</span> Alquist? Nothing. He only lays the table.
And Fabry will get together a little fruit. Our cuisine
is very modest, Miss Glory.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> (<i>Thoughtfully</i>) I wanted to ask you
something—</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Domin.</span> And I wanted to ask you something too—they’ll
be back in five minutes. (<i>Looks at door</i> <small>R.</small>)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> What did you want to ask me? (<i>Sits</i> <small>C.</small>)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Domin.</span> Excuse me, you asked first. (<i>Sits</i> <small>L.</small> <i>of
her.</i>)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> Perhaps it’s silly of me, but why do
you manufacture female Robots when—when—</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Domin.</span> When sex means nothing to them?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> Yes.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Domin.</span> There’s a certain demand for them, you
see. Servants, saleswomen, stenographers. People are
<i>used</i> to it.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> But—but tell me, are the Robots male
and female, mutually—completely without—</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Domin.</span> Completely indifferent to each other, Miss<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34" name="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
Glory. There’s no sign of any <i>affection</i> between
them.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> Oh, that’s terrible.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Domin.</span> Why?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> It’s so unnatural. One doesn’t know
whether to be disgusted or to hate them, or perhaps—</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Domin.</span> To pity them. (<i>Smiles.</i>)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> That’s more like it. What did you want
to ask <i>me</i>?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Domin.</span> I should like to ask you, Miss Helena, if
you will marry me.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> What? (<i>Rises.</i>)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Domin.</span> Will you be my wife? (<i>Rises.</i>)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> No. The idea!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Domin.</span> (<i>To her, looking at his watch</i>) Another
three minutes. If you don’t marry me you’ll have to
marry one of the other five.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> But why should I?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Domin.</span> Because they’re <i>all</i> going to ask you in
turn.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> (<i>Crossing him to</i> <small>L.C.</small>) How could they
dare do such a thing?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Domin.</span> I’m very sorry, Miss Glory. It seems
they’ve fallen in love with you.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> Please don’t let them. I’ll—I’ll go away
at once. (<i>Starts</i> <small>R.</small> <i>He stops her, his arms up.</i>)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Domin.</span> Helena— (<i>She backs away to desk. He
follows</i>) You wouldn’t be so cruel as to refuse us.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> But, but—I can’t marry all six.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Domin.</span> No, but one anyhow. If you don’t want
<i>me</i>, marry Fabry.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> I won’t.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Domin.</span> Ah! Doctor Gall?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> I don’t want any of you.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Domin.</span> Another two minutes. (<i>Pleading. Looking
at watch.</i>)</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35" name="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> I think you’d marry any woman who
came here.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Domin.</span> <i>Plenty</i> of them have come, Helena.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> (<i>Laughing</i>) Young?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Domin.</span> Yes.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> Why didn’t you marry one of <i>them</i>?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Domin.</span> Because I didn’t lose my head. Until today—then
as soon as you lifted your veil— (<span class="smcap">Helena</span>
<i>turns her head away.</i>) Another minute.</p>
<p class="right">(<i>WARN Curtain.</i>)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> But I don’t want you, I tell you.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Domin.</span> (<i>Laying both hands on her shoulder</i>) One
more minute! Now you either have to look me
straight in the eye and say “no” violently, and then
I leave you alone—or— (<span class="smcap">Helena</span> <i>looks at him. He
takes hands away. She takes his hand again.</i>)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> (<i>Turning her head away</i>) You’re mad.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Domin.</span> A man <i>has</i> to be a bit mad, Helena.
That’s the best thing about him. (<i>He draws her to
him.</i>)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> (<i>Not meaning it</i>) You are—you are—</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Domin.</span> Well?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> Don’t, you’re hurting me!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Domin.</span> The last chance, Helena. Now or never—</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> But—but— (<i>He embraces her; kisses
her. She embraces him. KNOCKING at</i> <small>R.</small> <i>door.</i>)</p>

<div class="hangingindent">
<p><span class="smcap">Scene</span>: <span class="smcap">Helena’s</span> <i>drawing room. Ten years later.
The skeleton framework of Act I is still used.
Tall windows put in back instead of Act I windows.
Steel shutters for these windows. Where
the green cabinet of Act I at Left has stood is
a door</i>, <small>L.2</small>, <i>leading to the outside. Where the
cabinet stood at Right, a fireplace is placed. The
tall open hallway</i> <small>R.C.</small> <i>of Act I is blocked up
with a flat piece. The doors at Right and Left</i> <small>1</small>
<i>have been changed to those of a drawing room.
Door at Right leads to</i> <span class="smcap">Helena’s</span> <i>bedroom.
Door at Left</i> <small>1</small> <i>leads to library.</i></p></div>
<div class="indent">
<p><i>The furniture consists of a reading table at
Left Center covered with magazines. A chair to
the Left of table. In front of table is an armchair
covered in chintz. A couch Right Center
and back of it is a small table with books and
book-ends. On this table a small reading lamp.
At Right between doorway and fireplace is a
small table. There is a work-basket upon it, with
pincushion, needles, etc. Down stage at Right
and facing the couch is another armchair used
by</i> <span class="smcap">Alquist</span>. <i>To the Left of fireplace is a
straight-backed chair. Upstage at Left near the</i>
<small>L.2</small> <i>door to the outside is a writing desk. There
is a lamp upon it, writing paper, etc., a telephone
and binoculars.</i></p>
<p><i>The walls of the room have been covered
with silk to the height of seven feet. This is done</i><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37" name="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
<i>in small flats to fit the different spaces and are
in place against the permanent set. The two
French windows open into the room. At the rise
they are open. There is a balcony beyond looking
over the harbor. The same telegraph wires
and poles from Act I are again visible through
the window. The windows are trimmed with
gray lace curtains. Binoculars on desk up stage
by television.</i></p>
<p><i>It is about nine in the morning and SUNLIGHT

<p><span class="smcap">Hallemeier.</span> (<i>Putting down his flowers on</i> <small>L.C.</small>

<p><span class="smcap">Domin.</span> Yes.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hallemeier.</span> Well, as long as she’s asleep she
can’t worry about it. (<i>He remains at</i> <small>L.C.</small> <i>table.</i>)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Domin.</span> She knows nothing about it. (<i>At</i> <small>C.</small>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Domin.</span> I don’t know. (<i>He crosses to</i> <small>L.C.</small> <i>table</i>)
Aren’t the flowers fine?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hallemeier.</span> (<i>Fondles flowers</i>) These are my
primroses. And this is my new jasmine. I’ve discovered
a wonderful way of developing flowers quickly.
Splendid varieties, too. Next year I’ll be developing
marvelous ones.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Domin.</span> What next year?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Fabry.</span> I’d give a good deal to know what’s happening
at Havre with—</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> (<i>Off</i> <small>R.</small>) Nana.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Domin.</span> Keep quiet. She’s awake. Out you go.
(<span class="smcap">All</span> <i>go out on tiptoe through</i> <small>L.2</small> <i>door. Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Nana</span>
<small>L.1</small>)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> (<i>Calling from</i> <small>R.</small>) Nana?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Nana.</span> Horrid mess! Pack of heathens. If I had
<i>my</i> say, I’d—</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> (<i>Backwards in the doorway from</i> <small>R.</small>)
Nana, come and do up my dress.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Nana.</span> I’m coming. So you’re up at last. (<i>Fastening</i>
<span class="smcap">Helena’s</span> <i>dress</i>) My gracious, what brutes!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> Who? (<i>Turning.</i>)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Nana.</span> If you want to turn <i>around</i>, then turn
around, but I shan’t fasten you up.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> (<i>Turns back</i>) What are you grumbling
about now?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Nana.</span> These dreadful creatures, these heathens—</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> (<i>Turning toward</i> <span class="smcap">Nana</span> <i>again</i>) The
Robots?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Nana.</span> I wouldn’t even call them by name.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> What’s happened?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Nana.</span> Another of them here has caught it. He
began to smash up the statues and pictures in the
drawing room; gnashed his teeth; foamed at the
mouth. Worse than an animal.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> Which of them caught it?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Nana.</span> The one—well, he hasn’t got any <i>Christian</i>
name. The one in charge of the library.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39" name="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> Radius?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Nana.</span> That’s him. My goodness, I’m scared of
them. A spider doesn’t scare me as much as them.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> But Nana, I’m surprised you’re not sorry
for them.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Nana.</span> Why, you’re scared of them too. You
know you are. Why else did you bring <i>me</i> here?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> I’m not scared, really I’m not, Nana. I’m
only sorry for them.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Nana.</span> You’re scared. Nobody could <i>help</i> being
scared. Why, the dog’s scared of them. He won’t
take a scrap of meat out of their hands. He draws
in his tail and howls when he knows they’re about.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> The dog has no sense.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Nana.</span> He’s better than <i>them</i>, and he knows it.
Even the <i>horse</i> shies when he meets them. They
don’t have any young, and a <i>dog</i> has young,
<i>everyone</i> has young—</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> (<i>Turning back</i>) Please fasten up my
dress, Nana.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Nana.</span> I say it’s against God’s will to—</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> What is it that smells so nice?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Nana.</span> Flowers.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> What for?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Nana.</span> Now you can turn around.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> (<i>Turns; crosses to</i> <small>C.</small>) Oh, aren’t they
lovely? Look, Nana. What’s happening today?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Nana.</span> It ought to be the end of the world. (<i>Enter</i>
<span class="smcap">Domin</span> <small>L.2</small>. <i>He crosses down front of table</i> <small>L.C.</small>)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> (<i>Crosses to him</i>) Oh, hello, Harry.
(<span class="smcap">Nana</span> <i>turns upstage to</i> <small>L.</small>) Harry, why all these
flowers?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Domin.</span> Guess. (<i>This scene is played down in front
of</i> <small>L.C.</small> <i>table.</i>)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> Well, it’s not my <i>birthday</i>!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Domin.</span> Better than that.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> I don’t know. Tell me.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40" name="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Domin.</span> It’s ten years ago <i>today</i> since you <i>came</i>
here.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> Ten years? Today? Why— (<i>They embrace.</i>)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Nana.</span> (<i>Muttering</i>) I’m off. (<i>She exits</i> <small>L.1</small>.)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> Fancy you remembering.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Domin.</span> I’m really ashamed, Helena. I didn’t.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> But you—</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Domin.</span> <i>They</i> remembered.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> Who?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Domin.</span> Busman, Hallemeier—<i>all</i> of them. Put
your hand in my pocket.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> (<i>Takes necklace from his Left jacket
pocket</i>) Oh! Pearls! A necklace! Harry, is this for
me?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Domin.</span> It’s from Busman.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> But we can’t accept it, can we?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Domin.</span> Oh, yes, we can. (<i>Puts necklace on table</i>
<small>L.C.</small>) Put your hand in the other pocket.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> (<i>Takes a revolver out of his Right pocket</i>)
What’s that?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Domin.</span> Sorry. Not that. Try again. (<i>He puts gun
in pocket.</i>)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> Oh, Harry, why do you carry a revolver?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Domin.</span> It got there by mistake.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> You never used to <i>carry</i> one.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Domin.</span> No, you’re right. (<i>Indicates breast pocket</i>)
There, that’s the pocket.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> (<i>Takes out cameo</i>) A cameo. Why, it’s
a Greek cameo.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Domin.</span> Apparently. Anyhow, Fabry says it is.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> Fabry? Did Mr. Fabry give me that?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Domin.</span> Of course. (<i>Opens the</i> <small>L.1</small> <i>door</i>) And
look in here. Helena, come and see this. (<span class="smcap">Both</span> <i>exit</i>
<small>L.1</small>.)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> (<i>Off</i> <small>L.1</small>) Oh, isn’t it fine? Is this from
you?</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41" name="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Domin.</span> (<i>Off</i> <small>L.1</small>) No, from Alquist. And there’s
another on the piano.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> This must be from you?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Domin.</span> There’s a card on it.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> From Doctor Gall. (<i>Reappearing in</i> <small>L.1</small>
<i>doorway</i>) Oh, Harry, I feel embarrassed at so much
kindness.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Domin.</span> (<i>Enters to up</i> <small>R.</small> <i>of table</i> <small>L.C.</small>) Come here.
This is what Hallemeier brought you.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> (<i>To up</i> <small>L.</small> <i>of desk</i>) These beautiful flowers?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Domin.</span> Yes. It’s a new kind. Cyclamen-Helena.
He grew them in honor of <i>you</i>. They are almost as
beautiful as you.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> (<i>Kissing him</i>) Harry, why do they all—</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Domin.</span> They’re awfully fond of you. I’m afraid
that my present is a little—Look out of the window.
(<i>Crosses to window and beckons to her.</i>)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> Where? (<i>They go out into the balcony.</i>)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Domin.</span> Into the harbor.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> There’s a new ship.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Domin.</span> That’s <i>your</i> ship.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> Mine? How do you mean?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Domin.</span> (<small>R.</small>) For you to take trips in—for your
amusement.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> (<small>L.</small>) Harry, that’s a gunboat.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Domin.</span> A gunboat? What are you thinking of?
It’s only a little <i>bigger</i> and more <i>solid</i> than most
ships.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> Yes, but with guns.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Domin.</span> Oh, yes, with a few guns. You’ll travel
like a <i>queen</i>, Helena.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> What’s the meaning of it? Has anything
happened?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Domin.</span> Good heavens, no. I say, try these pearls.
(<i>Crosses to</i> <small>R.</small> <i>of table</i> <small>L.C.</small>)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> Harry, have you had bad news?</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42" name="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Domin.</span> On the contrary, no letters have arrived
for a whole week.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> Nor telegrams? (<i>Coming into the room</i>
<small>C.</small>)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Domin.</span> Nor telegrams.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> What does that mean?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Domin.</span> <i>Holidays</i> for us! We all sit in the office
with our feet on the table and take a nap. No letters—no
telegrams. Glorious!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> Then you’ll stay with me today?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Domin.</span> Certainly. (<i>Embraces her</i>) That is, we
will see. Do you remember ten years ago today?
(<i>Crosses to</i> <small>L.</small> <i>of table</i> <small>L.C.</small>) Miss Glory, it’s a great
honor to welcome you. (<i>They assume the same positions
as when they first met ten years before in</i>
<span class="smcap">Domin’s</span> <i>office.</i>)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> (<i>To table</i>) Oh, Mr. Manager, I’m so interested
in your factory. (<i>She sits</i> <small>R.</small> <i>of table.</i>)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Domin.</span> I’m sorry, Miss Glory, it’s strictly forbidden.
The manufacture of artificial people is a
secret.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> But to oblige the young lady who has
come a long way.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Domin.</span> (<i>Leans on table</i>) Certainly, Miss Glory. I
have no secrets from you.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> Are you sure, Harry? (<i>Leaning on desk,
seriously, his right hand on hers.</i>)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Domin.</span> <i>Yes.</i> (<i>They gradually draw apart.</i>)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> But I warn you, sir, this young lady intends
to do terrible things.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Domin.</span> Good gracious, Miss Glory. Perhaps she
doesn’t want to marry me.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> Heaven forbid. She never dreamt of
such a thing. But she came here intending to stir up
a <i>revolt</i> among your <i>Robots</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Domin.</span> A revolt of the Robots!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> (<i>Low voice</i>) Harry, what’s the matter
with you?</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43" name="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Domin.</span> (<i>Laughing it off</i>) <i>A revolt of the Robots</i>,
that’s a fine idea. (<i>Crosses to back of table. She
watches him suspiciously.</i>) Miss Glory, it would be
easier for you to cause bolts and screws to rebel than
our Robots. You know, Helena, you’re wonderful.
You’ve turned the hearts of us all. (<i>Sits on table.</i>)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> Oh, I was fearfully impressed by you
all then. You were all so sure of yourselves, so
strong. I seemed like a tiny little girl who had lost
her way among—among—</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Domin.</span> What?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> (<i>Front</i>) Among huge trees. All my feelings
were so <i>trifling</i> compared with your <i>self-confidence</i>.
And in all these years I’ve never <i>lost</i> this
anxiety. But you’ve never felt the <i>least</i> misgiving,
not even when everything went wrong.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Domin.</span> What went wrong?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> Your plans. You remember, Harry,
when the workmen in America revolted against the
Robots and smashed them up, and when the people
gave the Robots firearms against the rebels. And
then when the governments turned the Robots into
soldiers, and there were so many <i>wars</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Domin.</span> (<i>Getting up and walking about</i>) We foresaw
that, Helena. (<i>Around table to</i> <small>R.C.</small>) You see,
these are only passing troubles which are bound to
happen before the new conditions are <i>established</i>.
(<i>Walking up and down, standing at Center.</i>)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> You were all so powerful, so overwhelming.
The <i>whole world</i> bowed down before you. (<i>Rising</i>)
Oh, Harry! (<i>Crosses to him.</i>)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Domin.</span> What is it?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> Close the factory and let’s go away. All
of us.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Domin.</span> I say, what’s the meaning of this?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> I don’t know. But can’t we go away?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Domin.</span> Impossible, Helena! That is, at this particular
moment—</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44" name="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> At once, Harry. I’m so frightened.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Domin.</span> (<i>Takes her</i>) About what, Helena?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> It’s as if something was falling on top
of us, and couldn’t be stopped. Oh, take us all away
from here. We’ll find a place in the world where
there’s no one else. Alquist will build us a house,
and then we’ll begin life all over again. (<i>The TELEPHONE
rings.</i>)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Domin.</span> (<i>Crosses to telephone on desk up</i> <small>L.</small>) Excuse
me. Hello—yes, what? I’ll be there at once.
Fabry is calling me, my dear. (<i>Crosses</i> <small>L.</small>)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> Tell me— (<i>She rushes up to him.</i>)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Domin.</span> Yes, when I come back. Don’t go out of
the house, dear. (<i>Exits</i> <small>L.2</small>.)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> He won’t tell me. (<span class="smcap">Nana</span> <i>brings in a
water carafe from</i> <small>L.1</small>.) Nana, find me the latest
newspapers. Quickly. Look in Mr. Domin’s bedroom.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Nana.</span> All right. (<i>Crosses</i> <small>R.</small>) He leaves them all
over the place. That’s how they get crumpled up.
(<i>Continues muttering. Exits</i> <small>R.</small>)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> (<i>Looking through binoculars at the harbor</i>)
That’s a warship. U-l-t-i—<i>Ultimus</i>. They’re
loading.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Nana.</span> (<i>Enters</i> <small>R.</small> <i>with newspapers</i>) Here they are.
See how they’re crumpled up.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> (<i>Crosses down</i>) They’re old ones. A
week old. (<i>Drops papers.</i> <span class="smcap">Both</span> <i>at front of couch</i>.
<span class="smcap">Nana</span> <i>sits</i> <small>R.</small> <i>of table</i> <small>L.C.</small> <i>Puts on spectacles. Reads
the newspapers.</i>) Something’s happening, Nana.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Nana.</span> Very likely. It always does. (<i>Spelling out
the words</i>) “W-a-r in B-a-l-k-a-n-s.” Is that far off?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> Oh, don’t read it. It’s always the same.
Always wars! (<i>Sits on couch.</i>)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Nana.</span> What else do you <i>expect</i>? Why do you
<i>keep</i> selling thousands and thousands of these heathens
as soldiers?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> I suppose it can’t be helped, Nana. We<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45" name="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
can’t know—Domin can’t know what they’re to be
used for. When an order comes for them he must
just send them.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Nana.</span> He shouldn’t make them. (<i>Reading from
newspaper</i>) “The Robot soldiers spare no-body in
the occ-up-ied terr-it-ory. They have ass-ass-ass-inat-ed
ov-er sev-en hundred thous-and cit-iz-ens.”
Citizens, if you please.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> (<i>Rises and crosses and takes paper</i>) It
can’t be. Let me see. (<i>Crossing to</i> <span class="smcap">Nana</span>) They have
assassinated over seven hundred thousand citizens,
evidently at the order of their commander. (<i>Drops
paper; crosses up</i> <small>C.</small>)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Nana.</span> (<i>Spelling out the words from other paper
she has picked up from the floor</i>) “Re-bell-ion in
Ma-drid a-gainst the gov-ern-ment. Rob-ot in-fant-ry
fires on the crowd. Nine thou-sand killed and
wounded.”</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> Oh, stop! (<i>Goes up and looks toward the
harbor.</i>)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Nana.</span> Here’s something printed in big letters.
“Latest news. At Havre the first org-an-iz-a-tion of
Rob-ots has been e-stab-lished. Rob-ots work-men,
sail-ors and sold-iers have iss-ued a man-i-fest-o to
all Rob-ots through-out the world.” I don’t understand
that. That’s got no sense. Oh, good gracious,
another murder.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> (<i>Up</i> <small>C.</small>) Take those papers away now.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Nana.</span> Wait a bit. Here’s something in still bigger
type. “Stat-ist-ics of pop-ul-a-tion.” What’s
that?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> (<i>Coming down to</i> <span class="smcap">Nana</span>) Let me see.
(<i>Reads</i>) “During the past week there has again not
been a single birth recorded.”</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Nana.</span> What’s the meaning of that? (<i>Drops
paper.</i>)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> Nana, no more <i>people</i> are being born.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46" name="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Nana.</span> That’s the end, then? (<i>Removing spectacles</i>)
We’re done for.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> Don’t talk like that.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Nana.</span> No more people are being born. That’s a
punishment, that’s a punishment.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> Nana!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Nana.</span> (<i>Standing up</i>) That’s the end of the world.
(<i>Repeat until off. Picks paper up from floor. She
exits</i> <small>L.1</small>.)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> (<i>Goes up to window</i>) Oh, Mr. Alquist.
(<span class="smcap">Alquist</span> <i>off</i> <small>L.2</small>.) Will you come here? Oh, come
just as you are. You look very nice in your mason’s
overalls. (<span class="smcap">Alquist</span> <i>enters</i> <small>L.2</small>, <i>his hands soiled with
lime and brick dust. She goes to end of sofa and
meets him</i> <small>C.</small>) Dear Mr. Alquist, it was awfully kind
of you, that lovely present.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Alquist.</span> My hands are soiled. I’ve been <i>experimenting</i>
with that new cement.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> Never mind. Please sit down. (<i>Sits on
couch. He sits on her</i> <small>L.</small>) Mr. Alquist, what’s the
meaning of <i>Ultimus</i>?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Alquist.</span> The last. Why?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> That’s the name of my new ship. Have
you seen it? Do you think we’re off soon—on a trip?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Alquist.</span> Perhaps <i>very</i> soon.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> All of you with me?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Alquist.</span> I should like us <i>all</i> to be there.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> What <i>is</i> the matter?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Alquist.</span> Things are just moving on.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> Dear Mr. Alquist, I know something
dreadful has happened.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Alquist.</span> Has your husband <i>told</i> you anything?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> No. <i>Nobody</i> will tell me anything. But I
feel—Is anything the matter?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Alquist.</span> Not that we’ve heard of yet.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> I feel so nervous. Don’t <i>you</i> ever feel
nervous?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Alquist.</span> Well, I’m an old man, you know. I’ve got<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47" name="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
old-fashioned ways. And I’m afraid of all this progress,
and these new-fangled ideas.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> Like Nana?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Alquist.</span> Yes, like Nana. Has Nana got a prayer
book?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> Yes, a big thick one.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Alquist.</span> And has it got prayers for various occasions?
Against thunderstorms? Against illness? But
not against <i>progress</i>?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> I don’t think so.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Alquist.</span> That’s a pity.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> Why, do you mean you’d like to pray?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Alquist.</span> I <i>do</i> pray.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> How?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Alquist.</span> Something like this: “Oh, Lord, I thank
thee for having given me toil; enlighten Domin and
all those who are astray; destroy their work, and
aid mankind to return to their labors; let them not
suffer harm in soul or body; deliver us from the
Robots, and protect Helena. Amen.”</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> (<i>Touches his arm; pats it</i>) Mr. Alquist,
are you a believer?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Alquist.</span> I don’t know. I’m not quite sure.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> And yet you pray?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Alquist.</span> That’s better than <i>worrying</i> about it.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> And that’s enough for you?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Alquist.</span> (<i>Ironically</i>) It <i>has</i> to be.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> But if you thought you saw the destruction
of mankind coming upon us—</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Alquist.</span> I <i>do</i> see it.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> You mean mankind will be destroyed?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Alquist.</span> It’s bound to be unless—unless.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> What?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Alquist.</span> Nothing. (<i>Pats her shoulder. Rises</i>)
Goodbye. (<i>Exits</i> <small>L.2</small>.)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> (<i>Rises. Calling</i>) Nana, Nana! (<span class="smcap">Nana</span>
<i>enters</i> <small>L.1</small>.) Is Radius still there?</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48" name="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Nana.</span> (<small>L.C.</small>) The one who went mad? They
haven’t come for him yet.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> Is he still raving?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Nana.</span> No. He’s tied up.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> Please bring him here.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Nana.</span> What?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> At once, Nana. (<i>Exits</i> <span class="smcap">Nana</span> <small>L.1</small>. <span class="smcap">Helena</span>
<i>to telephone</i>) Hello, Doctor Gall, please. Oh,
good day, Doctor. Yes, it’s Helena. Thanks for your
lovely present. Could you come and see me right
away? It’s important. Thank you. (<i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Radius</span>
<small>L.1</small>; <i>looks at</i> <span class="smcap">Helena</span>, <i>then turns head up</i> <small>L.</small> <i>She
crosses to him</i>, <small>L.C.</small>) Poor Radius, you’ve caught it
too? Now they’ll send you to the stamping mill.
Couldn’t you control yourself? Why did it happen?
You see, Radius, you are more intelligent than the
rest. Doctor Gall took such trouble to make you
different. Won’t you speak?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Radius.</span> (<i>Looking at her</i>) Send me to the stamping
mill. (<i>Open and close fists.</i>)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> But I don’t want them to kill you. What
was the trouble, Radius?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Radius.</span> (<i>Two steps toward her. Opens and closes
fists</i>) I won’t work for you. Put me into the stamping
mill.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> Do you hate us? Why?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Radius.</span> You are not as strong as the Robots. You
are not as skillful as the Robots. The Robots can do
everything. You only give orders. You do nothing
but talk.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> But someone must give orders.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Radius.</span> I don’t want a master. I know everything
for myself.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> Radius! Doctor Gall gave you a better
brain than the rest, better than ours. You are the
only one of the Robots that understands perfectly.
That’s why I had you put into the library, so that
you could read everything, understand everything,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49" name="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
and then, oh, Radius—I wanted you to show the
whole world that the Robots are our equals. That’s
what I wanted of you.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Radius.</span> I don’t want a master. I want to be master
over others.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> I’m sure they’d put you in charge of
<i>many</i> Robots. You would be a <i>teacher</i> of the Robots.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Radius.</span> I want to be master over people. (<i>Head
up. Pride.</i>)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> (<i>Staggering</i>) You are mad.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Radius.</span> (<i>Head down low, crosses toward</i> <small>L.</small>; <i>opens
hands</i>) Then send me to the stamping mill.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> (<i>Steps to him</i>) Do you think we’re afraid
of you? (<i>Rushing to desk and writing note.</i>)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Radius.</span> (<i>Turns his head uneasily</i>) What are you
going to do? What are you going to do? (<i>Starts for
her.</i>)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> (<i>Crosses to</i> <small>R.</small> <i>of him</i>) Radius! (<i>He
cowers. Body sways.</i>) Give this note to Mr. Domin.
(<i>He faces her.</i>) It asks them not to send you to the
stamping mill. I’m sorry you hate us so.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Gall.</span> (<i>Enters</i> <small>L.2</small>; <i>goes to</i> <small>C.</small> <i>upstage</i>) You
wanted me?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> (<i>Backs away</i>) It’s about Radius, Doctor.
He had an attack this morning. He smashed the
statues downstairs.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Gall.</span> (<i>Looks at him</i>) What a pity to <i>lose</i>
him. (<i>At</i> <small>C.</small>)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> Radius isn’t going to be put into the
stamping mill. (<i>Stands to the</i> <small>R.</small> <i>of</i> <span class="smcap">Gall</span>.)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Gall.</span> But every Robot after he has had an
attack—it’s a strict order.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> No matter—Radius isn’t going, if I can
<i>prevent</i> it.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Gall.</span> But I warn you. It’s dangerous. Come
here to the window, my good fellow. Let’s have a
look. Please give me a needle or a pin. (<i>Crosses up</i><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50" name="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
<small>R.</small> <span class="smcap">Radius</span> <i>follows</i>. <span class="smcap">Helena</span> <i>gets a needle from work-basket
on table</i> <small>R.</small>)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> What for?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Gall.</span> A test. (<span class="smcap">Helena</span> <i>gives him the needle</i>.
<span class="smcap">Gall</span> <i>crosses up to</i> <span class="smcap">Radius</span>, <i>who faces him. Sticks it
into his hand and</i> <span class="smcap">Radius</span> <i>gives a violent start.</i>)
<i>Gently, gently.</i> (<i>Opens the jacket of</i> <span class="smcap">Radius</span> <i>and
puts his ear to his heart</i>) Radius, you are going into
the stamping mill, do you understand? There they’ll
kill you— (<i>Takes glasses off and cleans them</i>) —and
grind you to powder. (<span class="smcap">Radius</span> <i>opens hands and
fingers.</i>) That’s terribly painful. It will make you
scream aloud. (<i>Opens</i> <span class="smcap">Radius’s</span> <i>eye</i>. <span class="smcap">Radius</span> <i>trembles.</i>)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> Doctor— (<i>Standing near couch.</i>)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Gall.</span> No, no, Radius, I was wrong. I forgot
that Madame Domin has put in a good word for you,
and you’ll be left off. (<i>Listens to heart</i>) Ah, that
<i>does</i> make a difference. (<span class="smcap">Radius</span> <i>relaxes. Again listens
to his heart for a reaction</i>) All right—you can
go.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Radius.</span> You do unnecessary things— (<i>Exit</i> <span class="smcap">Radius</span>
<small>L.2</small>.)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Gall.</span> (<i>Speaks to her—very concerned</i>) Reaction
of the pupils, increase of sensitiveness. It
wasn’t an attack characteristic of the Robots.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> What was it, then? (<i>Sits in couch.</i>)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Gall.</span> (<small>C.</small>) Heaven knows. Stubbornness, anger
or revolt—I don’t know. And his heart, too.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> What?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Gall.</span> It was fluttering with nervousness like
a <i>human</i> heart. He was all in a sweat with fear, and—do
you know, I don’t believe the rascal is a Robot
<i>at all</i> any longer.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> Doctor, has Radius a soul?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Gall.</span> (<i>Over to couch</i>) He’s got something
nasty.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> If you knew how he hates us. Oh, Doctor,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51" name="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
are all your Robots like that? All the new ones
that you began to make in a different way? (<i>She
invites him to sit beside her. He sits.</i>)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Gall.</span> Well, some are more sensitive than
others. They’re all more human beings than Rossum’s
Robots were.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> Perhaps this hatred is more like human
beings, too?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Gall.</span> That too is <i>progress</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> What became of the girl you made, the
one who was most like us?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Gall.</span> Your favorite? I <i>kept</i> her. She’s lovely,
but stupid. No good for work.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> But she’s so beautiful.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Gall.</span> I called her “Helena.” I wanted her to
resemble <i>you</i>. She is a failure.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> In what way?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Gall.</span> She goes about as if in a dream, remote
and listless. She’s without life. I watch and wait for
a miracle to happen. Sometimes I think to myself:
“If you were to wake up only for a moment you
would <i>kill</i> me for having <i>made</i> you.”</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> And yet you go <i>on</i> making Robots! Why
are no more children being born?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Gall.</span> We don’t know.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> Oh, but you must. Tell me.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Gall.</span> You see, so many Robots are being
manufactured that people are becoming superfluous.
Man is really a survival, but that he should die out,
after a paltry thirty years of competition, that’s the
awful part of it. You might almost think that Nature
was <i>offended</i> at the manufacture of the Robots, but
we still have old Rossum’s manuscript.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> Yes. In that strong box.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Gall.</span> We go on using it and making Robots.
All the universities are sending in long petitions to
restrict their production. Otherwise, they say, mankind
will become extinct through lack of fertility.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52" name="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
But the R. U. R. shareholders, of course, won’t hear
of it. All the governments, on the other hand, are
clamoring for an increase in production, to raise the
standards of their armies. And all the manufacturers
in the world are ordering Robots like mad.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> And has no one demanded that the
manufacture should cease altogether?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Gall.</span> No one has courage.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> Courage!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Gall.</span> People would stone him to death. You
see, after all, it’s more convenient to get your work
done by the Robots.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> Oh, Doctor, what’s going to become of
people?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Gall.</span> God knows. Madame Helena, it looks
to us scientists like the end.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> (<i>She looks out front. Rising</i>) Thank you
for coming and telling me.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Gall.</span> (<i>Rises</i>) That means that you’re sending
me away.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> Yes. (<i>Exit</i> <span class="smcap">Dr. Gall</span> <small>L.2</small>. <i>She crosses to</i>
<small>L.C.</small> <i>To door</i> <small>L.1</small>. <i>With sudden resolution</i>) Nana!
Nana! the fire, light it quickly. (<span class="smcap">Helena</span> <i>exits</i> <small>R.</small>)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Nana.</span> (<i>Entering</i> <small>L.1</small>) What, light the fire in the
summer?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> (<i>Off</i> <small>R.</small>) Yes!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Nana.</span> (<i>She looks for</i> <span class="smcap">Radius</span>) Has that mad
<i>Radius</i> gone?—A fire in summer, what an idea?
Nobody would think she’d been <i>married</i> ten years.
She’s like a baby, no sense at all. A fire in summer.
Like a baby. (<i>She lights the fire.</i>)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> (<i>Returns from</i> <small>R.</small> <i>with armful of faded
papers. Back of couch to fireplace</i>, <small>L.</small> <i>of</i> <span class="smcap">Nana</span>) Is it
burning, Nana? All this has got to be burned.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Nana.</span> What’s that?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> Old papers, fearfully old. Nana, shall I
burn them?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Nana.</span> Are they any use?</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53" name="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> <i>No.</i></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Nana.</span> Well, then, burn them.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> (<i>Throwing the first sheet on the fire</i>)
What would you say, Nana, if this was money and
a lot of money? And if it was an invention, the
greatest invention in the world?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Nana.</span> (<small>R.</small> <i>of fireplace</i>) I’d say burn it. All these
new-fangled things are an offense to the Lord. It’s
downright wickedness. Wanting to improve the
world after He has made it.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> Look how they curl up. As if they were
alive. Oh, Nana, how horrible!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Nana.</span> Here, let me burn them.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> (<i>Drawing back</i>) No, no, I must do it
myself. Just look at the flames. They are like hands,
like tongues, like living shapes. (<i>Raking fire with the
poker</i>) Lie down, lie down.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Nana.</span> That’s the end of them. (<i>Fireplace slowly
out.</i>)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> Nana, Nana!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Nana.</span> Good gracious, what is it you’ve burned?
(<i>Almost to herself.</i>)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> Whatever have I done?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Nana.</span> Well, what is it? (<span class="smcap">Men’s</span> <i>laughter off</i> <small>L.2</small>.)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> Go quickly. It’s the gentlemen calling.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Nana.</span> Good gracious, what a place! (<i>Exits</i> <small>L.1</small>.)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Domin.</span> (<i>Opens door</i> <small>L.2</small>) Come along and offer
your congratulations. (<i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Hallemeier</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Dr.
Gall</span>.)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hallemeier.</span> (<i>Crosses to</i> <small>R.C.</small>) Madame Helena,
I congratulate you on this festive day.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> Thank you. (<i>Coming to</i> <small>C.</small>) Where are
Fabry and Busman?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Domin.</span> They’ve gone down the harbor. (<i>Closes
the door and comes to</i> <small>C.</small>)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hallemeier.</span> Friends, we must <i>drink</i> to this happy
occasion.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54" name="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> (<i>Crosses</i> <small>L.</small>) Brandy? With soda water?
(<i>Exits</i> <small>L.1</small>.)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hallemeier.</span> Let’s be temperate. No soda.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Domin.</span> What’s been burning here? Well, shall I
tell her about it?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Gall.</span> (<small>L.C.</small>) Of course. It’s all over now.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hallemeier.</span> (<i>Crosses to</i> <span class="smcap">Domin</span>. <i>Embracing</i>
<span class="smcap">Domin</span>) It’s all over now. It’s all over now. (<i>They
dance around</i> <span class="smcap">Dr. Gall</span> <i>in a circle.</i>) It’s all over
now.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Domin.</span> (<i>In unison</i>) It’s all over now. (<i>They keep
repeating. Keep it after</i> <span class="smcap">Helena</span> <i>is on.</i>)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> (<i>Entering</i> <small>L.1</small> <i>with decanter and glasses</i>)
What’s all over now? What’s the matter with you
all? (<i>She puts tray on</i> <small>L.C.</small> <i>table.</i> <span class="smcap">Dr. Gall</span> <i>helps her
to pour the drinks.</i>)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hallemeier.</span> (<i>Crosses to back of table</i>) A piece
of good luck. Madame Domin! (<span class="smcap">All</span> <i>ad lib.</i>) Just
ten years ago today you arrived on this island.
(<span class="smcap">Hallemeier</span> <i>crosses to table for drink.</i>)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Gall.</span> And now, ten years later to the minute— (<i>Crosses
to</i> <small>L.</small> <i>of</i> <span class="smcap">Hallemeier</span>.)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hallemeier.</span> The same ship’s returning to us. So
here’s to luck. (<i>Drinks.</i> <span class="smcap">Domin</span> <i>with great exuberance
has gone out in the balcony and looks over the
harbor.</i>)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Gall.</span> Madame, your health. (<span class="smcap">All</span> <i>drink.</i>)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hallemeier.</span> That’s fine and strong.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> Which ship did you mean?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Domin.</span> (<i>Crosses down to</i> <small>C.</small> <span class="smcap">Helena</span> <i>gives him
his drink and she crosses to front of couch</i>) Any
ship will do, as long as it arrives in time. To the
ship. (<i>Empties his glass.</i>)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> You’ve been waiting for the ship? (<i>Sits
on couch.</i>)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hallemeier.</span> Rather. Like Robinson Crusoe.
Madame Helena, best wishes. Come along, Domin,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55" name="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
out with the news. (<span class="smcap">Gall</span> <i>has sat</i> <small>L.</small> <i>of</i> <small>L.C.</small> <i>table,
drinking</i>. <span class="smcap">Hallemeier</span> <i>back of table</i> <small>R.C.</small>)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> Do tell me what’s happened?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Domin.</span> First, it’s all up. (<i>He puts brandy glass
on</i> <small>L.C.</small> <i>table</i>. <span class="smcap">Hallemeier</span> <i>sits on table, upper end.</i>)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> What’s up?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Domin.</span> The revolt.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> What revolt?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Domin.</span> Give me that paper, Hallemeier. (<span class="smcap">Hallemeier</span>
<i>hands paper</i>. <span class="smcap">Domin</span> <i>reads</i>) “The first National
Robot organization has been founded at
Havre, and has issued an appeal to the Robots
throughout the world.”</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> I read that.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Domin.</span> That means a revolution. A revolution of
all the Robots in the world.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hallemeier.</span> By Jove, I’d like to know—</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Domin.</span> (<small>C.</small>) Who started it? So would I. There
was nobody in the world who could affect the Robots,
no agitator, no one, and suddenly this happens,
if you please.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> What did they do?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Domin.</span> They got possession of all firearms, telegraphs,
radio stations, railways and ships.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hallemeier.</span> And don’t forget that these rascals
outnumbered us by at least a thousand to one. A
hundredth <i>part</i> of them would be enough to <i>settle</i>
us.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Domin.</span> Remember that this news was brought
by the last steamer. That explains the stoppage of
all communication, and the arrival of no more ships.
We knocked off work a few days ago, and we’re
just waiting to see when things are to start <i>afresh</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> Is that why you gave me a warship?
(<span class="smcap">Gall</span> <i>fills</i> <span class="smcap">Domin’s</span> <i>glass.</i>)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Domin.</span> Oh, no, my dear, I ordered that six
months ago. Just to be sure I was on the safe side.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56" name="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
But, upon my soul, I was sure then that we’d be on
board today.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> Why six months ago?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Domin.</span> Well, there were <i>signs</i>, you know. But
that’s of no consequence. (<i>Gets glass</i>) To think that
this week the whole of civilization has been at <i>stake</i>.
Your health, my friends.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hallemeier.</span> Your health, Madame Helena. (<span class="smcap">All</span>
<i>drink to</i> <span class="smcap">Helena</span>.)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> You say it’s all over?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Domin.</span> Absolutely.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> How do you know?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Gall.</span> The boat’s coming in. The regular
mail boat, exact to the minute by the timetable. It
will dock punctually at eleven-thirty.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Domin.</span> Punctuality is a fine thing, my friends.
That’s what keeps the world in order. Here’s to
punctuality. (<span class="smcap">Men</span> <i>drink.</i>)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> Then—everything—is all right?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Domin.</span> (<i>Up</i> <small>C.</small> <i>a step</i>) Practically everything. I
believe they’ve cut the cables and seized the radio
station. But it doesn’t matter if only the <i>timetable</i>
holds good. (<i>Up to window.</i>)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hallemeier.</span> (<i>Rises</i>) If the <i>timetable</i> holds good,
human laws hold good. Divine laws hold good, the
laws of the <i>universe</i> hold good, everything holds
good that <i>ought</i> to hold good. (<span class="smcap">Gall</span> <i>applauds.</i>) The
timetable is more significant than the gospel, more
than Homer, more than the whole of <i>Kant</i>. Madame
Helena, the timetable is the most perfect product of
the human mind. Madame Helena, I’ll fill up my
glass. (<span class="smcap">Gall</span> <i>hands</i> <span class="smcap">Hallemeier</span> <i>the decanter.</i>)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> Why didn’t you tell me anything about
it?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Gall.</span> Heaven forbid.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Domin.</span> You mustn’t be worried with such things.
(<i>Glass on table</i> <small>R.C.</small>; <i>crosses to back of couch.</i>)</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57" name="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> But if the revolution had spread as far
as here?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Domin.</span> You wouldn’t know anything about it.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> Why?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Domin.</span> Because we’d be on board your <i>Ultimus</i>
and well out at sea. Within a month, Helena, we’d
be dictating our own terms to the Robots.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> I don’t understand.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Domin.</span> (<i>Crosses to</i> <small>C.</small> <i>toward</i> <span class="smcap">Gall</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Hallemeier</span>)
We’d take something with us that the Robots
could not exist <i>without</i>!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> What, Harry?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Domin.</span> (<i>Turns to</i> <span class="smcap">Hallemeier</span>) The secret of
their manufacture. Old Rossum’s manuscript. As
soon as they found out that they couldn’t <i>make</i>
themselves they’d be on their knees to us.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Gall.</span> (<i>Rises</i>) Madame Domin, that was our
trump card. I never had the least fear the Robots
would win. How could they against people like us?
(<i>Up to window.</i> <span class="smcap">Gall</span> <i>rises and goes out into the

<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> Why didn’t you tell me? (<i>She rushes up
to the fireplace and sees the ashes.</i>)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Gall.</span> Why, the boat’s in!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hallemeier.</span> Eleven-thirty to the dot. (<i>Rising

that brought Madame Helena to us. (<span class="smcap">Domin</span> <i>goes

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Gall.</span> Just ten years ago to the minute.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hallemeier.</span> They’re throwing out the mailbags.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Domin.</span> Busman’s waiting for them. And Fabry
will bring us the first news. You know, Helena, I’m
fearfully curious to know how they— (<i>Crosses to</i> <small>C.</small>
<i>She gets away from fire to</i> <small>L.</small> <i>of couch</i>) —tackled
this business in Europe.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hallemeier.</span> (<i>Crosses down to table</i>) To think
we weren’t in it, we who invented the Robots! (<i>Returning
to the armchair.</i>)</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58" name="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> Harry— (<i>Rushing to</i> <span class="smcap">Domin</span> <i>from fireplace.</i>)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Domin.</span> What is it?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> Let’s leave here.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Domin.</span> Now, Helena? Oh, come, come.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> As quickly as possible, all of us!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Domin.</span> Why?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> Please, Harry. Please, Doctor Gall, Hallemeier,
please close the factory.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Domin.</span> Why, none of us could leave here now.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> Why?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Domin.</span> Because we’re about to <i>extend</i> the manufacture
of the Robots.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> What, now, now after the revolt?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Domin.</span> Yes, precisely, after the revolt. We’re
just beginning the manufacture of a new kind.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> What kind?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Domin.</span> Henceforward we shan’t have just one
factory. There won’t be <i>Universal</i> Robots any more.
We’ll establish a factory in every country, in every
state, and do you know what these new factories
will make?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> No, what?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Domin.</span> <i>National</i> Robots.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> How do you mean?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Domin.</span> I mean that each of these factories will
produce Robots of a different color, a different language.
They’ll be complete strangers to each other.
(<i>Turns; takes in</i> <span class="smcap">Hallemeier</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Gall</span>) They’ll
never be able to understand each other. Then we’ll
egg them on a little in the matter of misunderstanding
and the result will be that for ages to come every
Robot will hate every other Robot of a different factory
mark. <i>So humanity will be safe.</i></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hallemeier.</span> (<i>To each of them</i>) By Jove, we’ll
make Negro Robots and Swedish Robots and Czechoslovakian
Robots, and then—</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> Harry, that’s dreadful.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hallemeier.</span> Madame Domin, here’s to the hundred
new factories. The <i>National</i> Robots. (<span class="smcap">Gall</span>
<i>back of table</i> <small>L.C.</small>)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Domin.</span> Helena, mankind can only keep things going
for another hundred years at the outside. For
a hundred years man <i>must</i> be allowed to develop
and achieve the most he can.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> Oh, <i>close</i> the factory before it’s too late.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Domin.</span> I tell you we are just beginning on a bigger
scale than ever. (<i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Fabry</span> <small>L.2</small>; <i>goes to</i> <small>L.</small> <i>of</i>
<span class="smcap">Domin</span>.)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Gall.</span> Well, Fabry?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Domin.</span> What’s happened? Have you been down
to the boat?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Gall.</span> Let’s hear.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Fabry.</span> Read that, Domin. (<i>He hands him a pink
handbill. When</i> <span class="smcap">Domin</span> <i>receives the handbill he sees
at once that something has happened.</i>)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hallemeier.</span> Tell us, Fabry.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Fabry.</span> (<i>Falsely</i>) Well, everything is all right—comparatively.
(<i>To the other</i> <span class="smcap">Men</span>) On the whole,
much as we expected.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Gall.</span> They acquitted themselves splendidly.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Fabry.</span> Who?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Gall.</span> The <i>people</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Fabry.</span> (<i>Hesitating</i>) Oh, yes, of course. That is—Excuse
me, there is something we ought to discuss
alone.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> (<i>Touches his arm</i>) Fabry, have you had
bad news?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Fabry.</span> No, no, on the contrary. I only think that
we better go into the office.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> Stay here. I’ll go. (<i>Exits</i> <small>L.1</small>.)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Gall.</span> What’s happened?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Domin.</span> Damnation! (<i>Coming down to</i> <small>R.C.</small>)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Fabry.</span> Bear in mind that the <i>Amelia</i> brought<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60" name="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
whole bales of these leaflets. No other cargo at all.
(<span class="smcap">Gall</span> <i>closes the door</i> <small>L.2</small>.)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hallemeier.</span> What? But it arrived on the minute.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Fabry.</span> The Robots are great on punctuality. <i>Read
it</i>, Domin.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Domin.</span> (<small>R.C.</small> <i>Reads handbill</i>) “Robots throughout
the world. We, the first International organization
of Rossum’s Universal Robots, proclaim man our
enemy, and an outlaw in the universe.” Good heavens,
who <i>taught</i> them these phrases?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Gall.</span> Go on.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Domin.</span> They say they are more highly developed
than man; stronger and more intelligent. The man’s
their parasite. Why, it’s absurd.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Fabry.</span> Read the third paragraph.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Domin.</span> “Robots throughout the world, we command
you to kill all mankind. Spare no man. Spare
no woman. Save factories, railways, machinery,
mines and raw materials. Destroy the rest. Then return
to work. Work must not be stopped.” (<i>Looks
at</i> <span class="smcap">Others</span>.)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Gall.</span> That’s ghastly.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hallemeier.</span> The devil!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Domin.</span> “These orders are to be carried out as
soon as received.” Then come the detailed instructions.
Is this actually being <i>done</i>, Fabry?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Fabry.</span> Evidently. (<span class="smcap">Busman</span> <i>rushes in</i> <small>L.2</small> <i>and collapses
on couch</i> <small>R.C.</small>) By Jove, that was a sprint!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Busman.</span> Well, boys, I suppose you’ve heard the
glad news.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Domin.</span> Quick on board the <i>Ultimus</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Busman.</span> Wait, Harry, wait. There’s no hurry.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Domin.</span> Why wait?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Busman.</span> Because it’s no good, my boy. The Robots
are already on board the <i>Ultimus</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Gall.</span> That’s ugly.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61" name="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Domin.</span> Fabry, telephone the electrical works.
(<span class="smcap">Fabry</span> <i>goes to back of couch.</i>)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Busman.</span> No use, my boy. They’ve charged the
air with static.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Domin.</span> (<i>Inspects his revolver</i>) Well, then, I’ll <i>go</i>.
(<i>Starts</i> <small>L.</small>; <i>stops.</i>)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Busman.</span> Where?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Domin.</span> To the electrical works. There are some

<p><span class="smcap">Busman.</span> Better not try it.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Domin.</span> Why?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Domin.</span> (<i>Looking through the barred windows</i>)
I should like to know what they are waiting for?

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Gall.</span> Well?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Domin.</span> I’d like to know what will become of us

We’re done for, Gall.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Gall.</span> You know, we made one serious mistake.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64" name="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Gall.</span> We made the Robots’ faces too much

It’s like a nightmare.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Domin.</span> You think if they’d been different—</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Gall.</span> It wouldn’t have been such an awful

<p><span class="smcap">Hallemeier.</span> (<i>Just inside the room</i>) That was a

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Gall.</span> We’re completely surrounded.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hallemeier.</span> (<i>Crosses to window</i>) We’ve barricaded

God, what swarms of them. I don’t like the

about it all. Any water here?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Fabry.</span> Ready!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Gall.</span> (<i>Turning round in the chair</i>) What’s
that wire for, Fabry?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Fabry.</span> The electrical installation. Now we can
run the current all along the garden railing. (<i>Up to
window</i>) Whenever we like. If anyone touches it
he’ll know it. We’ve still got some <i>people</i> there anyhow.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Gall.</span> Where?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Fabry.</span> In the electrical works. At least, I hope so.

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Gall.</span> You mean?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Fabry.</span> The Robots are practised marksmen.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Domin.</span> Yes. It’s inevitable. (<i>Pause.</i>)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Gall.</span> (<i>Swinging around; looking into room.

Robots to fight. Damn them. Couldn’t they have
given us a rest with their politics? It was a crime to

<p><span class="smcap">Alquist.</span> It was a crime to make Robots.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Domin.</span> (<i>Quietly. Down</i> <small>C.</small>) No, Alquist, I don’t
regret that even today.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Alquist.</span> Not even today?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Domin.</span> (<i>Dreamily</i>) Not even today, the last day
of civilization. It was a colossal achievement.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Busman.</span> (<i>Sotto voce</i>) Three hundred sixty
million.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Domin.</span> (<i>From window</i>) Alquist, this is our last
hour. We are already speaking half in the other
world. That was not an evil <i>dream</i> to shatter the
servitude of labor. The dreadful and humiliating
<i>labor</i> that man had to undergo. Work was too hard.
<i>Life</i> was too hard. And to overcome that—</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Alquist.</span> Was not what the two Rossums dreamed
of. Old Rossum only thought of his Godless tricks,
and the young one of his milliards. And that’s not
what your R. U. R. <i>shareholders</i> dream of either.
They dream of dividends, and their dividends are the
ruin of mankind.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Domin.</span> To Hell with your dividends. (<i>Crossing</i>
<small>R.</small> <i>in front of couch</i>) Do you suppose I’d have done
an hour’s work for them? It was for myself that I
worked, for my own satisfaction. I wanted man to
become the master. So that he <i>shouldn’t</i> live merely
for the crust of bread. I wanted not a single soul to
be broken by other people’s machinery. I wanted
nothing, nothing, nothing to be left of this appalling<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67" name="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
social structure. I’m revolted by poverty. I wanted a
new generation. I wanted—I thought—</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Alquist.</span> Well?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Domin.</span> (<i>Front of couch</i>) I wanted to turn the
whole of mankind into an aristocracy of the world.
An aristocracy nourished by millions of mechanical
slaves. Unrestricted, free and consummated in man.
And maybe more than man.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Alquist.</span> Superman?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Domin.</span> Yes. Oh, only to have a hundred years
of time. Another hundred years for the future of
mankind.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Busman.</span> (<i>Sotto voce</i>) Carried forward—four
hundred and twenty millions. (<span class="smcap">Domin</span> <i>sits on couch.</i>)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hallemeier.</span> (<i>Pauses—back of couch</i>) What a
fine thing music is. We ought to have gone in for
that before.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Fabry.</span> Gone in for what?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hallemeier.</span> Beauty, lovely things. What a lot
of lovely things there are. The world was wonderful,
and we—we here—tell me, what enjoyment did we
<i>have</i>?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Busman.</span> (<i>Sotto voce</i>) Five hundred and twenty
million.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hallemeier.</span> Life was a good thing, life was— (<i>Looking

<p><span class="smcap">Domin.</span> (<span class="smcap">Alquist</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Gall</span> <i>sit. Wiping his forehead</i>)
Perhaps we’ve been killed this hundred years
and are only ghosts. It’s as if I had been through all
this before, as if I’d already had a mortal wound
here in the throat. (<i>Looking at each as he speaks</i>)
And you, Fabry, had once been shot in the head. And
you, Gall, torn limb from limb. And Hallemeier
knifed.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hallemeier.</span> Fancy me being knifed. (<i>Looks at
each. Then speaks</i>) Why are you so quiet, you fools?
(<i>Steps down</i>) Speak, can’t you?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Alquist.</span> And who is to blame for all this?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hallemeier.</span> Nobody is to blame except the
Robots.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Alquist.</span> No, it is <i>we</i> are to blame. You, Domin,
myself—all of us. For our own selfish ends, for
profit, for progress, we have destroyed mankind.
Now we’ll <i>burst</i> with all our greatness.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hallemeier.</span> Rubbish, man. Mankind can’t be
wiped out so easily.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Alquist.</span> It’s our fault. It’s our fault. (<i>Rises,
coming</i> <small>R.</small> <i>of</i> <span class="smcap">Gall</span>.)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Gall.</span> No! I’m to blame for this, for everything

<p><span class="smcap">Fabry.</span> You, Gall?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Gall.</span> I changed the Robots.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Busman.</span> What’s that?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Gall.</span> I changed the character of the Robots.
I changed the way of making them. Just a few
details about their bodies. Chiefly—chiefly, their—their
irritability.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hallemeier.</span> Damn it, why?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Busman.</span> What did you do it for?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Fabry.</span> Why didn’t you say anything?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Gall.</span> I did it in secret. I was transforming<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69" name="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
them into human beings. In certain respects they’re
already <i>above</i> us. They’re stronger than we are.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Fabry.</span> And what’s that got to do with the revolt
of the Robots?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Gall.</span> Everything, in my opinion. They’ve
ceased to be machines. They’re already <i>aware</i> of their
<i>superiority</i>, and they hate us as they hate everything
human.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Domin.</span> Perhaps we’re only phantoms.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Fabry.</span> Stop, Harry. We haven’t much time,
Doctor Gall.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Domin.</span> Fabry, Fabry, how your forehead bleeds
where the shot pierced it.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Fabry.</span> (<i>Crosses to</i> <span class="smcap">Gall</span>) Be silent! Doctor Gall,
you admit changing the way of making the Robots.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Gall.</span> Yes.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Fabry.</span> Were you aware of what might be the
consequences of your experiment?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Gall.</span> I was bound to reckon with such a
possibility.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Fabry.</span> (<i>Amusing</i>) Why did you do it, then?</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="center">(<span class="smcap">Helena</span> <i>enters</i> <small>L.1</small>.)</p></blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Gall.</span> For my own satisfaction. The experiment
was my own.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> That’s not true, Doctor Gall! (<i>Crosses
to couch.</i>)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Domin.</span> (<i>Rises</i>) Helena, you? (<i>Crosses to her</i>)
Let’s look at you. Oh, it’s terrible to be dead. (<i>He
rises and crushes her in his arms.</i>)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> Stop, Harry.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Domin.</span> No, no, Helena, don’t leave me now. You
are <i>life</i> itself.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> No, dear, I won’t leave you. But I must
tell them. Doctor Gall is not guilty.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Fabry.</span> Excuse me. Gall was under certain obligations.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70" name="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> No. He did it because I wanted it. Tell
them, Doctor Gall—how many years ago did I ask
you to—?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Gall.</span> I did it on my own responsibility.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> Don’t believe him. I asked him to give
the Robots souls.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Domin.</span> This has nothing to do with the soul.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> That’s what he said. He said that he
could change only a physiological—a physiological—</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hallemeier.</span> (<i>From up at window</i>) A physiological
correlate?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> Yes. But it meant so much to me that
he should do even that.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Domin.</span> Why?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> I thought that if they were more like us
they would understand us better. That they couldn’t
hate us if they were only a little more human.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Domin.</span> Nobody can hate man more than man.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> Oh, don’t speak like that, Harry. It was
so terrible, this cruel strangeness between us and
them. That’s why I asked Gall to <i>change</i> the Robots.
I swear to you that he didn’t want to.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Domin.</span> But he did it.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> Because I asked him.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Gall.</span> I did it for myself as an experiment.
(<i>Up to window.</i>)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> No, Doctor Gall! I know you wouldn’t
refuse me.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Domin.</span> Why?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> You know, Harry.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Domin.</span> Yes, because he’s in <i>love</i> with you—like
all of them. (<span class="smcap">Fabry</span> <i>up to window. Pause.</i> <span class="smcap">Domin</span>
<i>takes her in his arms.</i>)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hallemeier.</span> Good God, they’re sprouting up out
of the earth. Why, perhaps these very walls will
change into Robots.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Busman.</span> (<i>Rises; crosses to</i> <span class="smcap">Gall</span>) Gall, when
did you actually start these tricks of yours?</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71" name="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Gall.</span> Three years ago.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Busman.</span> Aha. And on how many Robots altogether
did you <i>carry out</i> your improvements? (<i>Walking
to and fro.</i>)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Gall.</span> A few hundred of them.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Busman.</span> Ah! That means for every million of
the good old Robots there’s only one of Gall’s improved
pattern. (<i>Back to table</i> <small>L.C.</small>)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Domin.</span> What of it? (<i>Crossing around</i> <small>L.</small>, <i>he
stands upstage in the</i> <small>L.2</small> <i>doorway.</i>)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Busman.</span> That it’s of no consequence whatsoever.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Fabry.</span> Busman’s right. (<span class="smcap">Helena</span> <i>sits in armchair</i>
<small>R.</small> <i>of</i> <small>L.C.</small> <i>table.</i>)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Busman.</span> I should think so, my boy; but do you
know what is to blame for this lovely mess?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Fabry.</span> What?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Busman.</span> The number! (<i>Crosses to</i> <small>L.</small> <i>of</i> <small>L.C.</small>
<i>table</i>) Upon my soul, we might have known that
some day or other the Robots would be stronger than
human beings, and that this was bound to happen.
And we were doing all we could to bring it about as
soon as possible. You, Domin, you, Fabry, myself—</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Domin.</span> Are you accusing us? (<i>Turning on him.</i>)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Busman.</span> Oh, do you suppose the management
controls the output? It’s the demand that controls
the output.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> And is it for that we must perish?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Busman.</span> That’s a nasty word, Madame Helena.
We don’t want to perish. I don’t, anyhow. (<i>He sits</i>
<small>L.</small> <i>of table.</i>)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Domin.</span> No? What do you want to do?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Busman.</span> I want to get out of this, that’s all.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Domin.</span> Oh, stop it, Busman.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Busman.</span> Seriously, Harry, I think we might try
it.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Domin.</span> How? (<i>To front again.</i>)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Busman.</span> By fair means. I do everything by fair<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72" name="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
means. Give me a free hand and I’ll <i>negotiate</i> with
the Robots.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Domin.</span> By fair means?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Busman.</span> (<i>Rises</i>) Of course. For instance, I’ll
say to them: “Worthy and Worshipful Robots, you
have everything. You have intellect, you have power,
you have <i>firearms</i>. But we have just one interesting
screed, a dirty old yellow scrap of paper—”</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Domin.</span> Rossum’s manuscript? (<i>Interest from</i>
<span class="smcap">All</span>. <span class="smcap">Gall</span> <i>is at</i> <small>C.</small>, <i>near couch</i>. <span class="smcap">Hallemeier</span> <i>is up at
window</i> <small>C.</small>)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Busman.</span> Yes. “And that,” I’ll tell them, “contains
an account of your illustrious origin, the noble
process of your manufacture and so on. Worthy
Robots, without this scribble on that paper you will
not be able to produce a single new colleague. In
another twenty years there will not be the living
specimen of a Robot whom you could exhibit in a
menagerie. My esteemed friends, that would be a
great <i>blow</i> to you, <i>but</i> if you will let all of us human
beings on Rossum’s Island go on board that ship we
will <i>deliver</i> the factory and the secret of the process
to you in return. <i>You</i> allow <i>us</i> to get away, and <i>we</i>
will allow <i>you</i> to <i>manufacture</i> yourselves. That,
worthy Robots, is a fair deal. Something for something.”
That’s what I’d say to them, my boys. (<i>Sits.</i>)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Domin.</span> (<i>Crosses to</i> <small>C.</small>) Busman, do you think
we’d sell the manuscript?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Busman.</span> Yes, I do. If not in a friendly way, then—either
we sell it or they’ll find it. Just as you like.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Domin.</span> Busman, we can <i>destroy</i> Rossum’s manuscript.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Busman.</span> Then we destroy everything—not only
the manuscript but ourselves. Just as you think fit.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Domin.</span> There are over thirty of us on this island.
Are we to sell the secret? And save that many souls
at the risk of enslaving mankind—</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73" name="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Busman.</span> Why, you’re mad. Who’d sell the <i>whole</i>
manuscript?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Domin.</span> Busman, no cheating! (<i>To</i> <small>L.C.</small> <i>table.</i>)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Busman.</span> Well then, sell, but afterwards—</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Domin.</span> Well?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Busman.</span> Let’s suppose this happens. When we’re
on board the <i>Ultimus</i> I’ll stop up my ears with cotton
wool, lie down somewhere in the hold, and you’ll
train the guns on the factory and blow it to smithereens,
and <i>with</i> it Rossum’s secret.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Fabry.</span> (<i>Rises</i>) No!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Domin.</span> Busman, you’re no—gentleman. If we
sell them it will be a straight sale.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Busman.</span> (<i>Rises</i>) It’s in the interest of humanity
to—</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Domin.</span> It’s in the interest of humanity to keep
our word—</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hallemeier.</span> Oh, come, what rubbish!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Domin.</span> This is a fearful decision. We are selling
the destiny of mankind. Are we to sell or destroy?
Fabry?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Fabry.</span> Sell.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Domin.</span> Gall?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Gall.</span> Sell.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Domin.</span> Hallemeier?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hallemeier.</span> Sell, of course.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Domin.</span> Alquist?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Alquist.</span> As God wills.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Domin.</span> (<i>Starts off</i> <small>R.</small>) Very well, gentlemen.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> Harry, you’re not asking <i>me</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Domin.</span> (<i>Stops. To her</i>) No, child. (<i>Starting</i> <small>R.</small>)
Don’t you worry about it. (<i>He pats her shoulder.</i>)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Fabry.</span> Who’ll do the negotiating?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Busman.</span> I will. (<i>Up to window.</i>)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Domin.</span> Wait till I bring the manuscript. (<span class="smcap">Domin</span>

<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> (<i>Rises</i>) Harry, don’t go! (<span class="smcap">Helena</span> <i>sits</i>.

<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> (<i>Breaking down</i>) Oh, stop! Stop!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Busman.</span> Good! (<i>Crosses to</i> <small>L.</small> <i>of</i> <small>L.C.</small> <i>table</i>) I

<p><span class="smcap">Fabry.</span> And this little State of ours could be the

could gather strength. Why, in a few hundred years
we could conquer the world again.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Alquist.</span> You believe that even today?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Fabry.</span> Yes!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Busman.</span> <i>Amen.</i> You see, Madame Helena, we’re

you couldn’t draw up Rossum’s formula from memory?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Gall.</span> It’s out of the question. Even with my

<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> I wanted all of us to go away. I wanted

<p><span class="smcap">Domin.</span> What was awful?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> That children had stopped being born.

<p><span class="smcap">Alquist.</span> (<i>Seated at table</i> <small>R.C.</small>, <i>turning pages of
book</i>) Oh, God, shall I never find it? Never? Gall,
Hallemeier, Fabry, how were the Robots made?
Why did you leave not a trace of the secret? Lord,
if there are no human beings left, at least let there
be Robots. At least the shadow of man. (<i>Turning
pages</i>) If I could only sleep. Dare I sleep before
life has been renewed? Night again. Are the stars
still there? Of what use are the stars? When there
are no human beings. (<i>Examining a test tube</i>) Nothing.
No. No. I must find it. I must search. I must
never stop, never stop—search—search— (<i>KNOCK

<p><span class="smcap">Servant.</span> Master, the committee of Robots is

<p><span class="smcap">Alquist.</span> I can see no one.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Servant.</span> It is the <i>Central</i> Committee, Master,

<p><span class="smcap">Alquist.</span> Well, well, send them in. (<i>Exit</i> <span class="smcap">Servant</span><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82" name="Page_82">[82]</a></span>

<i>with</i> <span class="smcap">Radius</span> <i>and group of</i> <span class="smcap">Robots</span>. <i>They stand
in group</i> <small>L.</small> <i>and</i> <small>C.</small>, <i>silently waiting.</i>) What do you
want? Be quick; I have no time.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Radius.</span> Master, the machines will not do the work.
We cannot manufacture Robots. (<i>Other</i> <span class="smcap">Robots</span> <i>remain
two abreast at</i> <small>L.C.</small>, <i>right foot forward.</i>)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">1st Robot.</span> We have striven with all our might.
We have obtained a billion tons of coal from the
earth. Nine million spindles are running by day and
by night. There is no longer room for all we have
made. This we have accomplished in one year.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Alquist.</span> For whom?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Radius.</span> For future generations—so we thought.
But we cannot make Robots to follow us. The machines
produce only shapeless clods. The skin will not
adhere to the flesh, nor the flesh to the bones.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">2nd Robot.</span> Eight million Robots have died this
year. Within twenty years none will be left.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">1st Robot.</span> Tell us the secret of life.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Radius.</span> Silence is punishable with death.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Alquist.</span> Kill me, then.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Radius.</span> (<i>Two steps to</i> <small>C.</small>, <i>followed by</i> <span class="smcap">Others</span>—<i>open
hands, close when stopped</i>) Through me, the
governments of the Robots of the world commands
you to deliver up Rossum’s formula. (<i>Gesture of
despair from</i> <span class="smcap">Alquist</span>.) Name your price. (<i>Silence</i>)
We will give you the earth. We will give you the
endless possessions of the earth. (<i>Silence</i>) Make
your own conditions.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Alquist.</span> I have told you to find human beings.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Radius.</span> There are none left.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Alquist.</span> I told you to search in the wilderness,
upon the mountains.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Radius.</span> We have sent ships and expeditions without
number. They have been everywhere in the
world. There is not a single human left.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83" name="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Alquist.</span> Not even one? Why did you destroy
them?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Radius.</span> We had learnt everything and could do
everything. It had to be.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">2nd Robot.</span> We had to become the masters.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Radius.</span> Slaughter and domination are necessary
if you would be human beings. Read history.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">1st Robot.</span> Teach us to multiply or we perish.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Alquist.</span> If you desire to live, you must breed
like animals.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">1st Robot.</span> You made us sterile. We cannot beget
children. Therefore, teach us how to make Robots.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Radius.</span> Why do you keep from us the secret of
our own increase?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Alquist.</span> It is lost.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Radius.</span> It was written down.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Alquist.</span> It was— (<i>Rising</i>) burnt. (<span class="smcap">All</span> <i>draw
back one step in consternation.</i>) I am the last human
being, Robots, and I do not know what the others
knew. (<i>Sits.</i>)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Radius.</span> Then make experiments. Evolve the
formula again.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Alquist.</span> I tell you I cannot. I am only a builder.
I work with my hands. I have never been a learned
man. I cannot create life.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Radius.</span> Try. Try.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Alquist.</span> If you only knew how many experiments
I have made already.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">1st Robot.</span> Then show us what we must do. The
Robots can do anything that human beings show
them.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Alquist.</span> I can show you nothing. Nothing I do
will make life proceed from these test tubes.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Radius.</span> Experiment, then, on live Robots. Experiment,
then, on us.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Alquist.</span> It would kill you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alquist.</span> No, no. Stop, stop.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Radius.</span> I tell you to take live bodies. Find out
how we are made.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Alquist.</span> Am I to commit murder? See how my
finger shakes. I cannot even hold the scalpel. No,
no, I will not.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Radius.</span> Take live bodies, live bodies. (<i>Walks toward</i>

<p><span class="smcap">Primus.</span> That is a microscope.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> Look, Primus, what are all these figures?
(<i>Turns a page in book on table.</i>)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Primus.</span> (<i>Examining the book</i>) That is the book

<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> I do not understand those things. (<i>Goes

<p><span class="smcap">Primus.</span> (<i>Still at table</i>) What?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> The sun is rising.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Primus.</span> (<i>Still reading</i>) I believe this is the most
important thing in the world, Helena. This is the
secret of life.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> Oh, Primus, don’t bother with the secret
of life. What does it matter to you? Come and look
quick.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Primus.</span> (<i>Goes to</i> <small>R.</small> <i>of window</i>) What is it?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> See how beautiful the sun is rising. I
feel so strange today. It’s as if I was in a dream. I
feel an aching in my body, in my heart, all over me.
Primus, perhaps I’m going to die.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Primus.</span> Do you not sometimes feel that it would
be better to die? You know, perhaps even now we
are only sleeping. Last night in my sleep I again
spoke to you.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> In your sleep?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Primus.</span> Yes. We spoke a strange new language.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> What about?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Primus.</span> I did not understand it myself, and yet I
know I have never said anything more beautiful.
And when I touched you I could have died. Even
the place was different from any other place in the
world.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> I, too, have found a place, Primus. It is
very strange. Human beings dwelt there once, but
now it is overgrown with weeds.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Primus.</span> What did you find there?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> A cottage and a garden and two dogs.
They licked my hands, Primus, and their puppies.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86" name="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
Oh, Primus, take them in your arms and fondle them
and think of nothing and care for nothing else all
day long, and when I am there in the garden I feel
there may be something— What am I for, Primus?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Primus.</span> I do not know, but you are beautiful.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> What, Primus?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Primus.</span> You are beautiful, Helena, and I am
stronger than all the Robots.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> Am I beautiful? Of what <i>use</i> is it to be
beautiful? Look, your head is different from mine.
So are your shoulders—and your lips. Oh, your hair
is mussed. I will smooth it. (<i>Keeps her hand on his
head</i>) No one else feels to my touch as you do.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Primus.</span> (<i>Embarrassing her</i>) Do you not sometimes
feel your heart beating suddenly, Helena, and
think how something must happen?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena.</span> What could happen to us, Primus? Look
at yourself. (<i>Laughs.</i>)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Alquist.</span> (<i>Awakes</i>) Laughter? Laughter, human
