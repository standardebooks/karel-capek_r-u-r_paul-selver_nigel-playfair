			<p><b>Scene</b>: <i class="scene-description" epub:type="z3998:stage-direction"><span epub:type="z3998:persona">Helena’s</span> drawing room. Ten years later. The skeleton framework of Act <span epub:type="z3998:roman">I</span> is still used. Tall windows put in back instead of Act <span epub:type="z3998:roman">I</span> windows. Steel shutters for these windows. Where the green cabinet of Act <span epub:type="z3998:roman">I</span> at Left has stood is a door, <abbr epub:type="z3998:stage-direction">L.2</abbr>, leading to the outside. Where the cabinet stood at Right, a fireplace is placed. The tall open hallway <abbr epub:type="z3998:stage-direction">R.C.</abbr> of Act <span epub:type="z3998:roman">I</span> is blocked up with a flat piece. The doors at Right and Left 1 have been changed to those of a drawing room. Door at Right leads to <span epub:type="z3998:persona">Helena’s</span> bedroom. Door at Left 1 leads to library.</i></p>
			<p>
				<i class="scene-description" epub:type="z3998:stage-direction">The furniture consists of a reading table at Left Center covered with magazines. A chair to the Left of table. In front of table is an armchair covered in chintz. A couch Right Center and back of it is a small table with books and bookends. On this table a small reading lamp. At Right between doorway and fireplace is a small table. There is a workbasket upon it, with pincushion, needles, <abbr class="eoc">etc.</abbr> Down stage at Right and facing the couch is another armchair used by <span epub:type="z3998:persona">Alquist</span>. To the Left of fireplace is a straight-backed chair. Upstage at Left near the <abbr epub:type="z3998:stage-direction">L.2</abbr> door to the outside is a writing desk. There is a lamp upon it, writing paper, <abbr>etc.</abbr>, a telephone and binoculars.</i>
			</p>
			<p>
				<i class="scene-description" epub:type="z3998:stage-direction">The walls of the room have been covered with silk to the height of seven feet. This is done in small flats to fit the different spaces and are in place against the permanent set. The two French windows open into the room. At the rise they are open. There is a balcony beyond looking over the harbor. The same telegraph wires and poles from Act I are again visible through the window. The windows are trimmed with gray lace curtains. Binoculars on desk up stage by television.</i>

				<i class="scene-description" epub:type="z3998:stage-direction">It is about nine in the morning and <b>sunlight</b> streams into the room through the open windows. <span epub:type="z3998:persona">Domin</span> opens the door <abbr epub:type="z3998:stage-direction">L.2</abbr>; tiptoes in. He carries a potted plant. He beckons the <span epub:type="z3998:persona">Others</span> to follow him, and <span epub:type="z3998:persona">Hallemeier</span> and <span epub:type="z3998:persona">Fabry</span> enter, both carrying a potted plant. <span epub:type="z3998:persona">Domin</span> places flowers on the library table and goes to Right and looks toward <span epub:type="z3998:persona">Helena’s</span> bedroom <abbr epub:type="z3998:stage-direction">R.</abbr></i>
