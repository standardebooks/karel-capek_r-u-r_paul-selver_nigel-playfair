			<h2>R. U. R.<br/>
			<small>LIGHT CUES</small></h2>
			<p>Act I. Nothing.</p>
			<p>Act II. Fireplace on when <span class="smcap">Nana</span> strikes match. Off when <span class="smcap">Nana</span> says “There, that’s the end of them.”</p>
			<p>Act III. (one) table lamp and #17 off at start of Act, on at cue from <span class="smcap">Fabry</span>: “Ah, they are there.” Off on “And they are working.”</p>
			<p>(Two) Table lamp and #17 spot on at cue “Our people are still there”⁠—off on cue “A torch to be handed from age to age, from hand to hand forever.”</p>
			<p>(Three) Dim first-border spots #9, 10, and back stage hanging bunches on cue “Anything can be bought for half a billion.”</p>
			<p>(Four) The table “lamp-out” second time works simultaneous with the black out on cue: “A torch to be handed from hand to hand, from age to age.” Everything is pulled out except #18 and 20 (deep blue).</p>
			<p>(Five) With explosions in cellar the 2 1500-watt floor lamps at back (red) and brought up quickly to full and worked up and down quickly on dimmer until <span class="smcap">Radius</span> enters, when they remain on full to end of Act.</p>
			<p class="center">EPILOGUE</p>
			<p>A frost 1000-watt spot (frost) on stand off stage are lighted and blinded at rise. The blinds are opened when <span class="smcap">Radius</span> exits. The light floods the room through door at <small>R.</small> The blinds are closed when the <span class="smcap">Robot</span> exits on cue: “The Robots are stronger than you.”</p>
			<p>With entrance of <span class="smcap">Helena</span> and <span class="smcap">Primus</span> the sunrise effect begins. Floor lamp and stand lamp up stage at Right, both amber.</p>
			<p>With sunrise effect bring up #24 pink and #21 rose-pink. Foots up to ½ and overhead Xray (pink, frost, and steel-blue) full up.</p>
			<p>When all this is up to mark, dim #17 to out.</p>
